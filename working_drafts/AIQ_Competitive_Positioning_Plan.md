# AIQ Competitive Positioning Strategy: Document Restructuring Plan
*WORKING DRAFT - April 10, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to restructure the unified AIQ Competitive Positioning strategy into four specialized documents that provide greater depth, visual clarity, and actionable insights. The approach separates residential (HomeAIQ) and commercial (BusinessAIQ) strategies while distinguishing between general market positioning and detailed competitor analysis.

The restructuring will result in the following four documents:
1. **05.1_HomeAIQ_positioning.md**: Market position, value proposition, and go-to-market strategy for residential offerings
2. **05.2_HomeAIQ_competitor_analysis.md**: Detailed analysis of residential market competitors
3. **05.3_BusinessAIQ_positioning.md**: Market position, value proposition, and go-to-market strategy for commercial offerings
4. **05.4_BusinessAIQ_competitor_analysis.md**: Detailed analysis of commercial market competitors

This targeted approach will provide clearer strategic guidance while incorporating visual aids like positioning quadrants, competitive matrices, and market opportunity maps to enhance understanding and actionability.

## Strategic Rationale

The current consolidated document successfully articulates AIQ's dual-market strategy, but separating the content offers several key benefits:

- **Increased Depth**: Each document can explore its specific domain in greater detail
- **Targeted Usage**: Sales, marketing, and product teams can access precisely the information they need
- **Enhanced Visual Clarity**: Specialized visuals can be developed for each domain
- **Clearer Competitor Response**: More detailed competitive positioning and response strategies
- **Audience Appropriateness**: Content can be tailored to specific stakeholder interests

The separation also acknowledges the different maturity levels of the HomeAIQ and BusinessAIQ offerings, allowing for appropriate depth and focus in each domain.
