# HomeAIQ Investor Personas
*CONFIDENTIAL DRAFT - March 22, 2025*

This document outlines three ideal customer profile (ICP) personas representing different investor types who would evaluate the HomeAIQ business plan. Understanding these personas helps us anticipate questions, concerns, and areas of focus when presenting the investment opportunity.

## 1. Private Equity Limited Partner (PE LP) Persona

### Profile: Michael Harrington
- **Background**: 58-year-old former CIO of a Fortune 500 technology company
- **Current Role**: Managing Director at Catalyst Capital, a mid-market PE firm with $3.2B AUM
- **Investment Focus**: Growth-stage companies in technology-enabled services
- **Target Returns**: 3-5x return in 5-7 years
- **Check Size**: $15-50M initial investment with follow-on capacity

### Investment Criteria
- Established business models with proven unit economics
- Market leadership potential in fragmented industries
- Clear path to operational improvements and margin expansion
- Strong management teams with proven execution history
- Defined exit pathways with multiple potential acquirers

### Due Diligence Priorities
- Detailed financial model with assumptions clearly articulated
- Competitive landscape analysis with defensible advantages
- Customer acquisition costs and lifetime value metrics
- Evidence of operational scalability across markets
- Margin improvement opportunities through technology

### Risk Tolerance
- Moderate risk tolerance for proven business models
- Expects significant downside protection
- Prefers controlling positions with governance rights
- Values businesses with recurring revenue components
- Focuses heavily on market timing and execution risk

### Likely Response to HomeAIQ
Michael would be impressed by:
- The open-source business model parallels to Red Hat
- Clear articulation of unit economics and margin potential
- Robust recurring revenue growth projections
- Strong competitive moat against legacy integrators
- The multi-phase expansion strategy with acquisition opportunities

Michael would question:
- The early-stage nature of the business without operating history
- Heavy reliance on the founder without a complete executive team
- Competitive response from major ecosystem players (Apple, Google)
- Capital efficiency of the expansion strategy
- Valuation expectations without proven traction

His final evaluation would likely focus on:
"The HomeAIQ model is compelling and represents a classic technology-enabled disruption opportunity in a fragmented industry. However, the lack of operating history makes this more of a Series A venture deal than our typical growth equity investment. I'd need to see a completed executive team and initial market traction before seriously considering."

## 2. Angel Investor Persona

### Profile: Sarah Chen
- **Background**: 42-year-old former VP of Product at a successful smart home technology startup (acquired)
- **Current Role**: Angel investor and startup advisor
- **Investment Focus**: Early-stage technology companies in IoT, smart home, and consumer tech
- **Target Returns**: 10x+ return potential in 7-10 years
- **Check Size**: $100K-500K

### Investment Criteria
- Disruptive technology or business model innovation
- Strong founder with domain expertise and vision
- Large addressable market with clear pain points
- Capital-efficient path to early validation
- Network effects or other scaling advantages

### Due Diligence Priorities
- Technical feasibility and competitive differentiation
- Founder background and capability assessment
- Early customer or user validation (even if hypothetical)
- Go-to-market strategy and initial traction plan
- Cap table and future funding strategy

### Risk Tolerance
- High risk tolerance for early-stage ventures
- Comfortable with pre-revenue or pre-traction companies
- Values founder vision and market timing highly
- Invests in teams as much as concepts
- Accepts that most investments may fail while seeking a few outsized winners

### Likely Response to HomeAIQ
Sarah would be impressed by:
- The clear recognition of ecosystem fragmentation problems
- Leveraging existing Home Assistant community and technology
- Focus on high-margin service model with recurring revenue
- The contrarian approach against legacy integrators
- Detailed understanding of customer pain points across segments

Sarah would question:
- Whether customers will pay for integration at projected price points
- How HomeAIQ will build credibility against established brands
- Technical execution risk and quality control at scale
- Customer acquisition strategy and cost in competitive markets
- Founder's background in traditional services vs. technology

Her final evaluation would likely focus on:
"I love the open ecosystem approach and the parallel to Red Hat's model. The multi-billion dollar smart home industry is plagued by fragmentation that HomeAIQ could solve. Justin has the service business scaling experience, but I'd want to see a technical co-founder with deep Home Assistant expertise join the team. With that addition, this would be an exciting angel investment opportunity with massive upside potential."

## 3. Family Office Investor Persona

### Profile: William Thornton
- **Background**: 63-year-old retired founder of a successful nationwide service business
- **Current Role**: Head of investment strategy for Thornton Family Office ($250M AUM)
- **Investment Focus**: Blend of real estate, private equity, and direct investments in service businesses
- **Target Returns**: 2-3x return in 5-8 years with emphasis on capital preservation
- **Check Size**: $5-15M with patience for longer holding periods

### Investment Criteria
- Businesses with tangible assets or lasting customer value
- Clear connection to long-term macroeconomic trends
- Experienced management with proven execution capability
- Opportunity for strategic value-add from family office network
- Possibility of generational wealth creation and preservation

### Due Diligence Priorities
- Leadership team composition and succession planning
- Capital requirements through full business cycle
- Real-world customer value proposition and feedback
- Operational complexity and scaling challenges
- Long-term industry trends and technology risks

### Risk Tolerance
- Moderate risk tolerance with emphasis on capital preservation
- Prefers businesses with tangible value and operational history
- Typically avoids purely speculative investments
- Values steady growth over explosive scaling
- Comfortable with longer investment horizons than traditional PE

### Likely Response to HomeAIQ
William would be impressed by:
- The service business foundation with recurring revenue potential
- Long-term trend toward smart home adoption and integration
- Geographic expansion strategy with identified markets
- Acquisition strategy for traditional integrators
- Potential for building a national brand in a fragmented industry

William would question:
- The lack of initial operating history and proof points
- Heavy reliance on early funding rounds without demonstrated traction
- Competitive response from established luxury brands
- Timeline to profitability for each market
- Exit strategy and valuation expectations

His final evaluation would likely focus on:
"HomeAIQ represents an interesting combination of service business fundamentals with technology enablement. The family has several luxury properties with disappointing smart home implementations, so I understand the problem firsthand. However, the early stage and significant capital requirements make this more speculative than our typical investments. I'd consider a smaller initial investment with rights to participate in future rounds once the initial markets demonstrate traction."
