# HomeAIQ & BusinessAIQ: Milestone-Based Funding
*CONFIDENTIAL DRAFT - April 2025*

## Funding Strategy Overview

This document outlines our capital-efficient, milestone-based funding approach for the combined HomeAIQ and BusinessAIQ business. The strategy is designed to systematically de-risk investment while maintaining ambitious growth trajectories for both business lines. Rather than raising a large up-front sum, our plan implements a three-round funding structure where each investment is triggered only after achieving specific, measurable business milestones. This approach aligns investor and company interests by ensuring capital deployment follows demonstrated operational excellence and market validation.

The introduction of BusinessAIQ alongside HomeAIQ modestly increases our total funding requirements while significantly expanding our total addressable market and creating powerful synergies between residential and commercial integration. The dual-brand approach maximizes the efficiency of our capital deployment by leveraging shared technology, operational infrastructure, and geographic expansion across both business lines.

### Business Value Projection

Based on industry comparables and projected financial performance, we forecast the following business valuation trajectory:

- **Year 3** (post-Series A): $82-98M (10-12× EBITDA)
- **Year 5** (post-Series B): $220-245M (9-10× EBITDA)
- **Year 7** (potential exit): $323-400M (8.75-10.85× EBITDA)

Our base case exit projection in Year 7 assumes a 9.8× EBITDA multiple on $36.9M EBITDA, yielding a $361.6M valuation. This represents a significant increase over the residential-only plan in Revision 3, reflecting the additional value created by the BusinessAIQ division.

## Capital Deployment Strategy & Efficiency

Our capital deployment strategy is designed to maximize efficiency through five key principles:

### 1. Shared Infrastructure Investment

The dual-brand approach creates significant capital efficiency by leveraging shared resources:

- **Technical Platform**: The AIQ Hub core platform serves both residential and commercial clients, with specialized modules for each market. Development costs are amortized across a larger customer base.
- **Operations Infrastructure**: Support systems, monitoring infrastructure, and field service operations support both divisions, improving utilization and reducing duplication.
- **Geographic Expansion**: Opening a new market benefits both HomeAIQ and BusinessAIQ simultaneously, spreading market entry costs across two revenue streams.

### 2. Balanced Growth Investment

Capital allocation between HomeAIQ and BusinessAIQ will evolve over time:

- **Initial Round**: Heavily weighted toward HomeAIQ (82%) to establish immediate market presence and revenue, with foundational investment in BusinessAIQ (18%).
- **Series A**: Shifting to 70% HomeAIQ / 30% BusinessAIQ as the commercial division validates its model and begins scaling.
- **Series B**: Further balancing to 60% HomeAIQ / 40% BusinessAIQ as commercial operations reach scale and demonstrate strong growth potential.

This evolution ensures we maintain HomeAIQ's growth momentum while systematically building BusinessAIQ's capabilities and market presence.

### 3. Revenue-Based Scaling

Each funding round is tied to revenue achievements that validate our ability to efficiently deploy capital:

- **Initial Round to Series A**: Requires growth from $23.8M to $70.8M annual revenue (3× increase)
- **Series A to Series B**: Requires growth from $70.8M to $172.3M annual revenue (2.4× increase)
- **Series B to Exit**: Projects growth from $172.3M to $297.5M annual revenue (1.7× increase)

This approach ensures we demonstrate capital-efficient growth before receiving additional funding.

### 4. Margin Improvement Focus

Our capital deployment strategy emphasizes margin improvement through scale and increased recurring revenue:

- **Gross Margin**: Improving from 38.2% to 49.0% through purchasing power, operational efficiency, and increased recurring revenue
- **EBITDA Margin**: Growing from 8.0% to a peak of 14.3% before additional investment in Year 7 to prepare for continued scaling

These margin improvements demonstrate our ability to translate revenue growth into improved profitability, enhancing return on invested capital.

### 5. Self-Funding Operating Model

By Year 5, the business is projected to generate significant free cash flow, reducing reliance on external capital:

- **Year 5 EBITDA**: $24.5M
- **Year 5 Operating Cash Flow**: Approximately $18-20M after working capital and tax considerations
- **Maintenance Capex**: Estimated at $3-4M annually
- **Free Cash Flow**: Approximately $14-17M available for continued expansion

This self-funding capability provides strategic flexibility in the later years of our plan.

## Risk Mitigation Through Milestone-Based Approach

Our milestone-based funding strategy incorporates specific risk mitigation elements:

### 1. Staged Commitment Protection

By dividing total funding into three distinct rounds, investors benefit from:

- **Information Advantage**: Each subsequent round is made with substantially more data about business performance
- **Exit Option**: The ability to pause further investment if milestone targets are not achieved
- **Pricing Flexibility**: Opportunity to adjust valuation based on demonstrated performance

### 2. Balanced Debt/Equity Structure

Each funding round incorporates both equity and debt components:

- **Initial Round**: $15.2M equity + $5.8M debt (27.6% debt)
- **Series A**: $18.9M equity + $9.3M debt (33.0% debt)
- **Series B**: $9.5M equity + $7.0M debt (42.4% debt)

This balanced approach reduces dilution for equity investors while maintaining a conservative debt profile relative to projected EBITDA.

### 3. Milestone Validity Measures

Each funding trigger includes multiple metrics to ensure balanced, sustainable growth:

- **Revenue + EBITDA**: Ensuring growth is profitable, not just high-volume
- **Customer Count**: Validating market adoption across a broad customer base
- **Geographic Reach**: Confirming our ability to replicate success across markets
- **Recurring Revenue**: Verifying the development of stable, high-margin revenue streams

This multi-faceted approach prevents "vanity metrics" that could hide underlying business challenges.

### 4. Early Market Validation

The milestone triggers require:
- BusinessAIQ demonstrating 15+ successful commercial clients before Series A
- BusinessAIQ contributing 20%+ of revenue before Series B

These specific commercial validation targets ensure the dual-brand strategy is working before additional capital is committed.

This balanced approach ensures all stakeholders benefit from the company's success.

### 3. Capital Efficiency Metrics

- **Contribution Margin by Division**: Tracking the financial performance of HomeAIQ and BusinessAIQ separately

These metrics provide transparency into how effectively capital is being deployed.

### 4. Investor Reporting & Governance

- **Monthly Financial Reviews**: Regular reporting on key metrics and performance against plan
- **Quarterly Business Reviews**: Comprehensive assessment of progress toward milestones
- **Board Structure**: Balanced board representation from management and investors
- **Annual Strategic Planning**: Collaborative process to refine the strategy and capital plan

This governance framework ensures investors maintain visibility and input throughout the company's growth.
