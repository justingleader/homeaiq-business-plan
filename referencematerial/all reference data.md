## Problem, Market Opportunity, and Competitive Advantage

Smart Home Automation installers are either stuck in the past selling obsolete closed systems from the 2000's or are owned by hardware manufacturers (like Vivint). But Big tech (Apple, Amazon, and Google) have created semi-open platforms, causing hundreds of manufacturers to build high-quality, low-cost hardware. But installers/integrators haven't caught up to this potential:

### Market disruption creates a new industry

#### Legacy home integrators are locked into expensive and outdated tech
- Until 2015, home automation was dominated by luxury manufacturers (Crestron, Control4) with closed platforms that could only be installed and customized by authorized partners.
- Legacy whole-home systems average between $50K and $2M+
- Almost all smart home integrators in the US still base their solutions on these outdated platforms due to inertia and losing their shrinking customer base.

#### Creation of cheap, high-quality smart home hardware
- With the introduction of Alexa and follow-on products from Apple and Google, hundreds of millions of people have dedicated smart home devices based on semi-open platforms.
- Hardware manufacturers pivoted to support this mid-market in dozens of hardware categories. For example: Lutron, the luxury lighting global giant, adapted their luxury smart lighting product, RadioRa into their mid-market line, Caseta, which addresses 90% of residential needs at 20% of the cost.
- Hardware manufacturers now support the open standards like Zigbee, Z-wave, Matter, and Thread, as well as the semi-open protocols from Apple, Amazon, and Google.

### Disruption has led to a new market leader and a gap in support

#### Open-source Home Assistant platform is the dominant hub
- This open-source platform runs locally at the home on $50 hardware and connects to thousands of smart products.
- It has over 460,000 active installations and is growing >50% YoY.
- Allows for integration and unification across Google, Amazon, and Apple platforms, as well as with huge manufacturers like Ikea, Ecobee, Lutron, Samsung, Leviton, and many more.
- #1 open-source project on Github in 2024 with over 1,400 developers delivering weekly feature updates.

#### Highly competitive opportunity to deliver smart homes on open-source Hub
- The business model of implementing and supporting open-source software has been proven with successful examples (Red Hat acquired by IBM for $34B).
- Massive cost/price advantages over partners of legacy smart home products (Crestron, Control4) while still delivering high quality features.
- Ability to "meet customers where they are" and use any smart devices they already have allows for low barrier to entry for customers. Competitors require substantial hardware replacement to begin service.

## Business Model – Multiple Revenue Streams drive our $30M EBITDA Target

HomeAIQ generates revenue through multiple complementary streams, designed for both upfront cash flow and recurring income:

### Four Valuable Revenue Streams

#### Hardware Margin
As part of projects, we provide and install devices (sensors, lights, A/V equipment, etc.), earning a markup on hardware. For each type of product, we pick a few 'approved' products each year, and we invest heavily in sourcing strategies to drive down costs. We're not 'brand-agnostic' - we choose from the best vendors and give them a chance to offer us great high-margin deals. Hardware contributes ~30% of project revenue on average. This strategic vendor relationship approach ensures quality control while maximizing our margins.

[Chart showing Year 7 Hardware Revenue by Customer Tiers:]
- Luxury: $173.2M
- Enthusiast: $18.49M
- Basic: $1.18M

#### Installation Services
We charge a project fee for custom design and installation of smart home systems. This covers on-site labor, configuration, and user training. Gross margins on labor are high (our efficient processes yield ~50–60% margin). Customers gladly pay for expert setup, with a median revenue of $14,700 per project. Our mean revenue reaches $125,000, reflecting our ability to serve both mainstream homeowners and premium installations.

[Chart showing Labor Revenue over 7 years, with growth to approximately 36 million by Year 7]

#### Support Subscriptions
This is our growing recurring revenue engine. Clients pay 5-7% of their installation cost for annual support, which includes 24/7 remote monitoring, software updates, and live and AI chat support. We proactively troubleshoot issues via remote access and push new integrations. For luxury customers, support plans average $12K annually and include comprehensive programming and warranty support. With minimal service costs, this is a high-margin stream that scales with our install base. We're targeting 2,500+ recurring revenue customers by year 7, creating a substantial and predictable revenue foundation.

[Chart showing Revenue and Cost by Tier:]
- Luxury: ~$9M revenue, ~$6M cost
- Enthusiast: ~$2.5M revenue, ~$1.8M cost
- Basic: ~$0.5M revenue, ~$0.3M cost

#### Referrals & Partnerships
HomeAIQ earns commissions by linking our customers with specialist third-party services. Examples: security monitoring (if a client wants professional camera monitoring, we refer them to premium partners like Deep Sentinel), or whole home battery installations from specialized providers. We also explore revenue-sharing with device makers for featuring their products. While a smaller slice (~1%) of revenue, it's almost pure profit that contributes 3% of the EBITDA and increases the system network effect.

## Go-To-Market: High-Leverage Customer Acquisition Plans

HomeAIQ will focus on high ROI customer acquisition and marketing strategies.

### Strategic Customer Acquisition

#### Legacy System Replacements
We'll purchase customer lists from obsolete legacy providers (RTI, Crestron, Control4, Savant) and target them with compelling rip-and-replace services. These customers are already invested in home automation but trapped in outdated, closed ecosystems—making them prime candidates for our open, future-proof solution.

#### Life-Event Solutions
We'll develop targeted marketing playbooks for specific life transitions that create immediate smart home needs. Some high value examples:
- New Parents: Customized packages featuring nursery monitoring, smart audio detection with alerts, automated nightlights, and temperature control systems that help new parents manage their changing lifestyles.
- Aging-in-Place: Comprehensive monitoring solutions for adult children supporting elderly parents, including fall detection, medication reminders, simplified interfaces, automated check-ins, and communication tools that preserve independence while ensuring safety, and can be done much cheaper than low-quality niche "geriatric" market products.
- New Pet Owners: Specialized systems for monitoring, feeding, and interacting with pets remotely, turning a common pain point into an entry point for broader smart home adoption.

### Market Expansion Catalysts

#### Neighborhood Security Focus
We'll identify and market to neighborhoods experiencing significant crime rate increases. These residents have urgent security needs but limited options—typically restricted to overpriced security companies offering proprietary equipment with long-term monitoring contracts. HomeAIQ will offer superior integrated security solutions (advanced camera systems with AI detection, automated lighting, doorbell integration, and smart locks) without the predatory contracts. We'll create targeted marketing highlighting the cost-effectiveness and superior capabilities of our open platform compared to traditional security vendors.

#### Builder Partnerships
We'll establish partnerships with home builders to pre-install HomeAIQ infrastructure in new developments. While initially low-margin, this strategy delivers high volume and connects us with customers at the beginning of their homeownership journey. We'll install "future-ready" components (like dedicated wiring for automated shades and strategic outlet placement) that enable high-margin upgrades later as homeowners expand their systems.

#### Climate Change Response
We'll target neighborhoods experiencing climate challenges with specialized packages. Examples include air quality monitoring, ventilation, and purification systems for wildfire-prone areas, automated fire defense for high-risk regions, and comprehensive water/mold detection systems in hurricane-vulnerable locations. This positions HomeAIQ as a solution to increasingly urgent security and safety concerns as climate change brings new challenges to regions.

## Organic and Acquisition Geographic Expansion

HomeAIQ's growth plan includes both organic and inorganic growth in locations to reach a US population of 120M+ within 7 years.

### Geographic Expansion

#### De-risked Phased Approach
Starting in tech-forward California markets allows HomeAIQ to perfect its model before expanding nationwide. This measured growth ensures profitability in Year 3 before accelerating expansion, significantly reducing execution risk.

#### Acquisition/Organic Balance
The dual approach uses acquisitions for immediate market presence while building higher-margin organic growth. Acquisitions provide trained technicians and existing customers, while organic expansion leverages established infrastructure for better profitability.

#### Market-Specific Targeting
Markets are selected for specific demand drivers: wildfire regions need environmental monitoring, high-crime areas seek security, and extreme climate zones require smart HVAC. This targeted approach ensures higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

## Risk and Resilience: Built for a Volatile World

HomeAIQ stands out as a smart home integrator engineered to thrive amid economic volatility, climate pressures, and social upheavals. By integrating home security, energy efficiency, automation, and connectivity, HomeAIQ's business model is inherently diversified and adaptable. This breadth enables it to weather macroeconomic downturns, respond to crisis-driven demand surges, and align with emerging consumer needs. Below, we break down how HomeAIQ is positioned for stability and growth in an uncertain future, with data and real-world insights illustrating its resilience.

### Resilience to Macroeconomic Fluctuations
Even when the broader economy faces headwinds, HomeAIQ's offerings remain in demand as essential home services rather than discretionary luxuries. Home security and safety solutions, in particular, are often considered "needs" rather than wants, giving the industry a reputation for being recession-resistant. (1) This dynamic was evident during recent turbulent times:

- Stable Demand in Downturns: The security industry historically holds up well in recessions because cutting back on safety is rarely an option (2)
- Home Investment During Crises: Uncertain times can actually prompt homeowners to invest more in their living spaces. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic – which triggered a global economic slowdown – people spent additional time at home and redirected spending toward home improvement and technology upgrades (3). Smart home solutions saw increased adoption as households invested in comfort, remote-monitoring, and DIY upgrades while other expenditures (like travel or dining out) were on hold.
- Value and Cost Savings: HomeAIQ's energy management services offer cost savings that appeal during inflationary periods or budget-tightening. Smart thermostats and energy-efficient automation help reduce utility bills, a benefit that becomes especially attractive when energy costs are high or incomes are strained.

### Climate Change & Energy Market Volatility
HomeAIQ offers smart home solutions that address climate change and energy efficiency. The company is well-positioned to benefit from several key trends:

- Energy Cost Savings: With volatile energy prices, HomeAIQ's ability to reduce consumption through smart HVAC controls, automated shades, and efficient appliance scheduling provides significant value.
- Surging Need for Resilience: Rising grid instability has spurred demand for home battery systems that provide backup power during outages. HomeAIQ's platform integrates seamlessly with whole-home batteries like Tesla Powerwall, offering intelligent power management during blackouts. The system automatically prioritizes critical loads (refrigeration, medical equipment, security systems) while shutting down non-essential devices to extend battery life. During normal operations, HomeAIQ's AI optimizes battery charging to take advantage of lower off-peak rates and maximize solar integration when available.

### Thriving Amid Societal Upheaval and Shifting Needs
Beyond economics and climate, HomeAIQ also demonstrates resilience to societal upheavals – from public health crises to social unrest. HomeAIQ's versatile platform is well-suited to adapt to these shifts and even leverage them as opportunities to serve emerging needs:

- Public Health Crises and Remote Living: Pandemic lockdowns accelerated smart home adoption, as noted by industry analyses that reported a rise in demand for smart home products driven by COVID-19 impacts. (5)
- Rising Crime and Social Unrest: HomeAIQ's sophisticated security offerings beat legacy offerings from tired vendors like ADT. This responds to ever-increasing fears over crime danger. 64% of Americans believed national crime increased in 2024 with 49% reporting increased local crime. (6).
- Aging Populations: Societal changes also include longer-term shifts like aging populations, urbanization, and changing work patterns. For example, with more seniors choosing to age in place at home rather than move to assisted living, there's growing demand for home automation that can assist with daily tasks and safety (fall detectors, smart medication dispensers, voice-activated controls for those with mobility issues).

## Why Our Team? HomeAIQ Origin Story

### From Justin:
My story with Smart Home Automation mirrors how I built my previous company in Atlassian support. In 2012, I was rolling out Jira and Agile at the video game company I was a producer at, but I was hitting my head against some of the automations. I called a couple of Atlassian-certified services vendors, and ended up on the phone with the founder of one of them. In describing what I wanted, he thought I talked really well about Jira, and he ended up offering me a consulting job! A couple years later, I founded my own Atlassian partner company, which my wife and I grew and then sold in 2023.

During the building of the company, my wife and I had 3 kids, and left Los Angeles during Covid. After the sale, we were able to move back to Los Angeles and buy an amazing dream home 2 blocks from a great school. As a technology lover, I was particularly excited about the smart home setup. It had one of those 'luxury' smart home systems (RTI) run out of a server closet in the basement. Lights, blinds, TVs, and whole-home audio all controlled from a central system! When we got there, I got the RTI dealer to come and fix a couple things. During his visit, I asked him: "Okay, can you show me how to log into the system so I can edit the automations and what the buttons do?" And he said, "no, sorry, only certified vendors can log into the system." And I was just like… What? So even though I had customized technology for Disney and Dell, to customize what the buttons on my wall do I need to pay a guy $250 an hour?

And so I went on an exciting journey, following the footsteps of many technology professionals, diving into Home Assistant. I ripped out all the old RTI stuff and discovered a whole world of potential.

But what I didn't find? Anyone to help me with smart home tech that wasn't a 'closed system.'

Every 'smart home' vendor in Los Angeles was tied to an ancient, closed system like Control4 or Crestron. They didn't support Home Assistant, almost any of my existing hardware, and couldn't help me. After a year of spending my free time getting deep into the Home Assistant ecosystem, I developed the HomeAIQ plan, which is informed by my success building tools for businesses:
- People respond to great user experiences
- People love problem solvers
- A win-win partner ecosystem can drive immense revenue

### Model Assumptions and Inputs

#### Services Offered
For purposes of modeling the business, we designed a matrix of service packages across two dimensions: Customer Tier and Segment. The three customer tiers (Luxury, Enthusiast, and Basic) each were modeled to have a unique service for three service segments: New Home Build, Renovation, and Improvement. That gives us 9 potential services. Below are the current numbers for one instance of each individual service:

[Table showing the 9 service combinations with the following data points for each: Hardware Revenue, Hardware COGS, Labor Hours, Labor Revenue, Labor Internal COGS, Gross Profit]

Basic New Home Build: $8,610 revenue, $7,061 COGS, 46 hrs, $5,688 labor revenue, $4,095 labor COGS, $3,142 gross profit
Basic Renovation: $5,100 revenue, $4,136 COGS, 48 hrs, $6,000 labor revenue, $4,320 labor COGS, $2,643 gross profit
Basic Improvement: $465 revenue, $383 COGS, 9 hrs, $1,170 labor revenue, $842 labor COGS, $410 gross profit

#### Customer Mix and Growth
An average initial customer mix for acquired and organically grown locations, as well as the customer growth, is modeled. Our current model estimates that acquired locations will have a customer mix initially very heavy with luxury clients. But we believe significant growth in customers is in the mid-market with enthusiast customers, so both location types shift to over 50% enthusiast customers while maintaining a significant high-margin luxury customer base.

Acquired Year 1 Customer 50:
- Year 1: 5% growth, 5% Basic, 20% Enthusiast, 75% Luxury
- Year 2: 10% growth, 15% Basic, 30% Enthusiast, 55% Luxury
- Year 3: 15% growth, 25% Basic, 40% Enthusiast, 35% Luxury
- Year 4: 20% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury
- Year 5: 20% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury
- Year 6: 20% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury
- Year 7: 20% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury

Grown Year 1 Customer 50:
- Year 1: 5% growth, 10% Basic, 50% Enthusiast, 40% Luxury
- Year 2: 10% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury
- Year 3: 15% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury
- Year 4: 20% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury
- Year 5: 20% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury
- Year 6: 20% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury
- Year 7: 20% growth, 15% Basic, 55% Enthusiast, 30% Luxury

Average Location Project Type Mix:
- New Home Build: 30.00%
- Renovation: 25.00%
- Small Improvement: 45.00%

#### Hardware Margins from Vendors

### One Example Service: Luxury New Home Build

Below is the service used for the financial model of an "average" luxury customer's new home build. This encompasses a wide range of smart home categories and products, including the pricing based on our assumptions of manufacturer discounts and billing out our staff at $125 per hour.

### Global Home Services M&A Overview: Strong Demand

Multiples for transactions with an Enterprise Value above $25 million generally continue to move upwards. We expect multiples to remain healthy as interest rates are projected to decline this year.

#### Global Deal Activity has Slowed Amid Macroeconomic Conditions
[Chart showing deal volume and count from Q1 2019 through Q1 2024*]

#### Lower Middle Market EV / EBITDA Multiples (by Deal Size)
Enterprise Value ranges from 2003-2023:
- $10-$25M: 5.8x to 7.7x
- $25-$50M: 6.5x to 9.1x
- $50-$100M: 7.5x to 8.5x
- $100-$250M: 8.1x to 9.3x
- $250-$500M: 8.9x to 11.0x

#### Deals Under $500MM Dominate Deal Volumes
[Chart showing percentage breakdown of deals by size from 2017-2024*]

### Global Home Services M&A Overview: Strong Demand (continued)

Home Services valuations are trending up across the board with deal volumes also increasing in Roofing, Landscaping, and HVAC.

#### HVAC / Plumbing / Electrical
Average EBITDA Multiple: Increasing from 5.7x in 2017 to 8.1x in 2023

#### Landscaping
Average EBITDA Multiple: Increasing from 5.8x in 2003-2018 to 6.7x in 2022-2023

#### Pest Control
Average EBITDA Multiple: Increasing from 4.8x in 2008-2015 to 9.7x in 2020-2023

#### Roofing
Average EBITDA Multiple: Increasing from 5.2x in 2006-2018 to 6.1x in 2023

#### Home Services Buyer Feedback
- Maintenance and repair businesses bring higher multiples than product or construction companies.
- If you can prove out greenfield growth and validate 4-12 markets, valuations can increase into the double-digits.
- Management teams that are eager to grow organically and through M&A are very attractive.
- In seasonally cyclical home service businesses, having multiple locations across geographies diversifies revenue streams and risk.

### Home Services Are In Demand by Consumers and Investors

HomeAIQ's financial projections illustrate a clear path to achieving ~$30 million in EBITDA by Year 7, driven by aggressive expansion, multiple revenue streams, and increasing contributions from new service segments. The plan is ambitious but grounded in benchmarks from industry data and comparable companies.

#### Strong Demand Will Keep Rates High
Home Services demand has been greater than skilled worker supply for years. 70% of surveyed skilled trade professionals say the current trade shortage is a major problem (3). This gap is expected to persist and continue to grow through 2030 (3). In this demand environment, we expect services rates will continue to be a premium.

[Chart showing trade wages trend higher: 4.9% construction labor wages increased from March 2023 to March 2024, 17% higher than the increase across all employment in the same period. 650,000 more job openings develop in the construction trades industry every year.]

#### Investment Growth and Acquisition Trends
Investment in U.S. home services has surged over the past few years, marked by record deal activity and rising capital inflows. Exit multiples in residential services are still high compared to other similar industries, due to heavy consolidation and private equity interest, with >$14B in acquisitions in 2023 (2).

[Chart showing acquisitions in Home Services from 2019 Q1 to 2024 Q1]

#### Private Equity has high demand for a wide array of home services companies, not just HVAC:
- In 2021, KKR acquired Neighborly, one of the largest home services franchising platforms (encompassing 29 brands and 4,800 franchisees), in a deal believed to be one of the biggest ever in the franchising world (4).
- In late 2020, Roark (a PE firm known for franchised businesses) bought ServiceMaster Brands for about $1.55 billion. ServiceMaster Brands owns franchises like Merry Maids (home cleaning) and ServiceMaster Restore (disaster restoration), and Roark's acquisition was a play to consolidate and grow these home service franchises. (5)

### Luxury Dashboards
[Multiple dashboard screenshots showing user interfaces for smart home control systems, including:
- Energy dashboard with solar panel monitoring
- Multi-room security camera views
- Home Assistant control panel with various device tiles
- Floor plan view with temperature controls
- 3D floor plan with sensor locations
