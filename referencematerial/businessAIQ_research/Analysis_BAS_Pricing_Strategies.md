## 1\. Breakdown by Building Size and Use Type

**Small Commercial Buildings (<50,000 sq. ft.):** Small buildings often face the highest *per-square-foot* BAS costs because the fixed base cost is spread over fewer square feet. Traditional BAS installations can range roughly **$2.50–$7.00 per sq. ft.**[buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=A%20building%20automation%20system%20,format%20stores). For example, a **50,000 sq. ft. building** might incur **$125,000–$350,000** for a full BAS installation [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=A%20building%20automation%20system%20,format%20stores). This high cost has historically put advanced BAS out of reach for many small offices, retail stores, or small schools (indeed, 98% of U.S. small buildings have **no BAS** due to cost barriers [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=A%20building%20automation%20system%20,format%20stores) ). Simpler use-cases (e.g. a small **office or retail** with basic HVAC and lighting control) would be at the **lower end** of the range ( $2–$4/sq.ft.), while a specialized small facility (for instance, a **clinic or lab** with stringent climate control) could hit the **upper end** (~$6–$7/sq.ft.). New **IoT-based BAS** offerings are a game-changer for this segment – using wireless sensors and cloud software, a basic system can cost as little as **$0.75/sq.ft.** (≈$12.5k for 50k sq.ft.) [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=building%20systems%20are%20non,based%20approaches), dramatically lower than traditional systems. In fact, IoT BAS packages today may cost only **$5k–$50k per building**, making automation feasible for small buildings that previously couldn’t justify it. Small buildings that adopt BAS typically focus on core needs (HVAC scheduling, simple lighting control), and often choose **cloud-managed or “lite” BAS** products to minimize upfront hardware and labor costs.

**Mid-Sized Buildings (50,000–200,000 sq. ft.):** Mid-size facilities – such as multi-story **office buildings**, mid-size **hospitals** or medical centers, **hotels** with a few hundred rooms, large **big-box retail stores**, or **educational buildings** (e.g. a high school or small university building) – generally justify a full BAS and see better economies of scale. **Cost per square foot** typically falls in the **$2.50–$5.00/sq.ft. range** for a moderately equipped BAS [info.midatlanticcontrols.com](https://info.midatlanticcontrols.com/blog/how-much-does-a-building-automation-system-cost#:~:text=Image%3A%20Photo%20of%20a%20BMS,50). That translates to roughly **$125,000–$1,000,000+** for buildings in this size class, with a mid-point example: a 100,000 sq. ft. office building might spend on the order of **$250k–$500k** for a comprehensive BAS (at $2.50–$5.00/sq.ft.). The wide range reflects the use-case complexity: A **100k sq. ft. data center** or research facility (heavy cooling and monitoring needs) will push toward the higher end, whereas a **100k sq. ft. standard office** or school (basic HVAC, lighting) would be nearer the lower end. In mid-size buildings, owners often integrate multiple systems (HVAC, lighting, security, fire alarms, etc.), which adds cost but improves efficiency. For instance, adding extensive **lighting and access control** integration could raise costs per sq.ft. slightly (each additional subsystem adds points/devices to control). On the other hand, mid-size buildings can leverage semi-proprietary or **integrator-friendly systems** (like Tridium Niagara-based solutions) to keep costs competitive, often landing around **$3–$4/sq.ft. on average** for a typical commercial building. Use-case specifics: **Hospitals** or healthcare facilities in this range have more complex ventilation and monitoring (infection control, backup systems), so they tend to be on the higher side ( $5+/sq.ft.), whereas a **hotel** or **office** of similar size might be closer to the ~$3–$4 range if systems are more conventional. Mid-size **industrial sites** (e.g. a 100k sq.ft. factory) often automate only certain areas (production environments, critical storage) and may not blanket the entire facility with BAS, effectively keeping the *average* cost per sq.ft. toward the low end by leaving warehouses or low-occupancy zones with minimal controls.

**Large Buildings (200,000+ sq. ft.):** Large facilities – e.g. **office campuses**, high-rise office **towers**, **major hospitals** and medical centers, expansive **industrial plants**, large **data centers**, big **university complexes**, or large **hotel-resorts** – almost always employ a comprehensive BAS. Thanks to scale, the **per-square-foot cost** often stabilizes or even drops compared to smaller buildings, typically in the ballpark of **$2.00–$4.00 per sq.ft.** for a state-of-the-art BAS in 2024 (assuming standard HVAC, lighting, and security integration). In absolute terms, however, initial costs are significant: a 200,000 sq. ft. building might invest **$500k–$1M+** upfront, and a mega-campus or high-rise (500k–1M+ sq.ft.) can see BAS projects in the **several million dollar** range. For example, if we apply the industry range, a 300,000 sq.ft. high-rise could easily be a **$1M+ installation**. Complex large-scale use cases drive the higher end: **Hospitals** in this size class (with surgical suites, isolation rooms, specialized air handling) or large **data centers** (massive cooling and redundancy needs) might exceed $4/sq.ft. (even **$5–$7/sq.ft.** in extreme cases) due to the density of sensors and controls needed. In contrast, a simpler large **warehouse or office tower** might be closer to $2/sq.ft. if systems are straightforward. It’s worth noting that beyond a certain scale, vendors often offer volume discounts on hardware, and the engineering labor doesn’t scale linearly – this can cap the per-foot cost even as the building grows larger. For instance, one source notes **$2.50/sq.ft. as a typical floor** for traditional BAS costs [info.midatlanticcontrols.com](https://info.midatlanticcontrols.com/blog/how-much-does-a-building-automation-system-cost#:~:text=Image%3A%20Photo%20of%20a%20BMS,50) (even large projects rarely drop below this without cutting scope). Large buildings typically integrate all major building systems (HVAC, lighting, fire, security, elevators, etc.), so the *scope* of work is broader – this adds to total cost but also creates more value (and often is mandated by code for life-safety integration in big facilities). **Data centers** and mission-critical facilities are a special case: they often require enhanced BAS capabilities (e.g. integration with power management, generator and UPS monitoring, and very tight temperature/humidity control). These factors make data center BAS *more expensive per sq.ft.* than a generic commercial building [info.midatlanticcontrols.com](https://info.midatlanticcontrols.com/blog/how-much-does-a-building-automation-system-cost#:~:text=The%20type%20of%20business%20also,its%20electronic%20equipment%20running%20optimally). Similarly, a large **university campus building** with research labs might have costs approaching healthcare projects due to specialized ventilation. On the other hand, **industrial plants** might use separate process control systems for production and use BAS mainly for environment and HVAC in control rooms or offices – their BAS costs per building sq.ft. can thus be relatively low if much of the space is process-dedicated. In summary, large buildings see **economies of scale** (the $/sq.ft. cost tends to be lower than small buildings), but absolute project budgets are high, and high-complexity facilities will budget at the upper end of the range to cover all required control points.

*Cost per square foot benchmarks:* Industry sources consistently cite **approximately $2.50–$7.00 per sq.ft.** as the typical range for BAS installations across various building sizes [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=A%20building%20automation%20system%20,format%20stores). Simpler buildings and those at scale lean to the lower end, while complex facilities (or very small ones) hit the upper end. These figures refer to **initial installation**. It’s important to note that new construction can be slightly cheaper to automate than retrofitting an older building (wiring and installation is easier to integrate during construction) [info.midatlanticcontrols.com](https://info.midatlanticcontrols.com/blog/how-much-does-a-building-automation-system-cost#:~:text=,an%20older%20legacy%20traditional%20BMS). Retrofits may incur extra costs for interfacing with legacy equipment or performing upgrades. The **type of systems integrated** also impacts cost per sq.ft.: adding advanced systems like lab humidity control, integrated fire alarm override, or smart elevators will increase the point count and cost. By contrast, a minimal “HVAC-only” BAS is cheaper (some small buildings opt to only automate HVAC to save money). Therefore, when evaluating per-square-foot costs, **office buildings and schools** typically sit at the lower-middle end, **hotels and retail** in the mid-range (due to many zones and occupancy controls), and **hospitals and data centers** at the top end due to critical systems and redundancy. Data from Intel and others suggest that modern IoT-based solutions can significantly undercut these traditional cost ranges for smaller/simpler projects, but for **medium and large buildings**, the $2.5–$7/sq.ft. range remains a useful planning guideline as of 2024.

## 2\. Vendor-Specific Pricing Comparison

Major BAS vendors in North America include **Honeywell**, **Siemens**, **Johnson Controls (JCI)**, **Schneider Electric**, **ABB** (recently in BAS via its Cylon acquisition), **Carrier** (Automated Logic), as well as others like **Trane**, **Delta Controls**, **Distech** etc. Each offers a suite of hardware (controllers, sensors, networking devices) and software. While all operate in the similar cost frameworks discussed above, there are nuances in how they price installations, software, and services. Below is a comparison by vendor, broken down into key cost categories:

### Honeywell

- **Initial Installation Costs:** Honeywell’s BAS offerings cover everything from small-building systems to enterprise-level solutions. Initial install pricing (hardware + software + labor) for Honeywell systems is **comparable to industry averages** – roughly in the 2.5–$5 per sq.ft. range for typical projects, scaling with building size and complexity (e.g. a Honeywell BAS in a 100k sq.ft. office might be on the order of a few hundred thousand dollars). Honeywell often bids these projects through their authorized integrators or branches. The **labor** portion (engineering, programming, commissioning) can be significant; Honeywell’s branch offices charge standard industry labor rates, and for large projects they may offer competitive bids. There aren’t flat “Honeywell rates” publicly available, as each project is quoted based on scope, but expect the hardware (controllers, sensors, supervisory servers) to account for a large share of the upfront cost, with the remainder in labor and software licensing.
- **Ongoing Maintenance/Service:** Honeywell typically offers service contracts through Honeywell Building Solutions (HBS) or certified contractors. Ongoing **maintenance fees** are usually optional but recommended – these may include routine preventive maintenance on sensors and controllers, software updates, and remote monitoring. Costs often run **5–15% of the initial system cost per year** as a rule of thumb (closer to 5% for large systems, possibly 10%+ for smaller ones). For example, if a Honeywell BAS install was $200k, an annual service agreement might be on the order of $10k–$20k/year. These contracts ensure calibration of sensors, replacement of failed parts, and software support. Alternatively, customers can opt for time-and-materials service calls (with labor rates similar to HVAC service labor). Honeywell’s service pricing is in line with competitors – high-margin but often negotiable if bundled with installation or multi-year commitments.
- **Software Licensing Models:** Honeywell has both proprietary and open-platform software in its portfolio. For larger installations, Honeywell’s legacy **EBI (Enterprise Building Integrator)** or newer **Forge** platform might be used – these are typically licensed per site or per server. For instance, a site license might allow a certain number of points or subsystems. Pricing for these enterprise systems is not published, but often rolled into the project cost. For small to mid buildings, Honeywell often uses **WEBs-N4**, which is basically the Tridium **Niagara** framework under Honeywell branding. Niagara-based systems use a **per-controller (device) and per-point** licensing model [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2). For example, a “WEB-8000” controller (JACE) might come with a license for up to X devices and Y points; expanding beyond that costs more. Honeywell (like other Niagara OEMs) typically includes the software license in the controller purchase, up to a certain point count, and charges for expansions or additional features (graphics packages, analytics, etc.). There may also be an annual **Software Maintenance Agreement (SMA)** for Niagara-based systems (usually ~ **10-15% of software cost** per year) to get updates, though owners can choose not to renew and keep using the last version [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2). In summary, Honeywell’s licensing can be **“per system”** for enterprise software or **Niagara-standard (per device/point)** for WEBs controllers.
- **Hardware Pricing:** Honeywell manufactures a range of controllers (programmable DDC controllers for HVAC equipment, VAV box controllers, IoT wireless sensors, etc.). **Controller costs** vary by capability: a simple unitary HVAC controller might be a few **hundred dollars** list price, while a large plant controller or integration engine can be **$1,000+** each. For example, Honeywell Spyder or CIPer model controllers might list around $300–$800, whereas a WEBs JACE (embedded server) could be $1,500–$3,000+. Field sensors (temperature, pressure) are generally ~$50–$200 each. Actual prices to end users often include a markup by the installer. Honeywell’s hardware pricing is broadly similar to Siemens, JCI, etc., and volume discounts can apply on large jobs.
- **Notable Pricing Features/Discounts:** Honeywell often competes by bundling offerings – e.g. integrating **HVAC equipment sales with BAS**. If a customer is buying Honeywell HVAC or security systems, Honeywell might discount the BAS portion. Honeywell also has financing options for projects (sometimes marketed as energy performance contracts). For smaller buildings, Honeywell’s newer **Forge** cloud analytics platform is offered as a subscription (which can overlay on a BAS to provide analytics and energy saving insights), but the core BAS control system is generally a one-time investment plus maintenance. In terms of discounts, Honeywell (like other vendors) tends to give **better pricing on large-scale projects** (multi-building or campus installations) and to long-term clients. Their authorized system integrators can also offer **Niagara-based solutions at lower cost** to compete in the mid-market, leveraging non-proprietary pricing (this addresses cost-sensitive clients who might otherwise go with an independent Niagara system). Overall, Honeywell’s pricing model is **tiered by system size** – smaller systems use more off-the-shelf pricing (with Niagara controllers), while large complex installations involve custom quotes and often negotiated pricing.

### Siemens

- **Initial Installation Costs:** Siemens is known for enterprise-grade BAS (historically **Apogee** and now **Desigo** ). Their systems are often found in large buildings and campuses (office towers, hospitals, etc.), and initial costs are typically at the higher end of the spectrum – not necessarily more expensive *per point* than competitors, but Siemens often tackles very complex jobs. A full Siemens BAS for a large building will similarly fall in the **$2–$6 per sq.ft. range** (depending on scope), so a 200k sq.ft. building might see ~$500k+ for Siemens controls. The upfront quote usually includes proprietary Siemens hardware (field controllers, supervisory controllers) and software. **Labor** is provided by Siemens’ branch or authorized partners, and those labor rates are comparable to other OEMs. One distinguishing factor: Siemens sometimes uses more centralized controllers (their Apogee PXCM controllers, etc.) which are high-capacity and can be pricey (one Siemens Apogee PXC processor was listed around **$7,500** for a controller unit [plchardware.com](https://www.plchardware.com/Products/94/5407759/default.aspx?srsltid=AfmBOopg8VJ7SDtsniAm06Tke4cqvfIykLNrq62I9-xZppVW3RNticm_#:~:text=Siemens%20DESIGO%20Building%20Automation%20,00) ). This means the cost structure might be a few high-cost controllers covering many points, rather than many small controllers. The net hardware cost balances out to industry norms, but line-item prices can look high. For new construction projects, Siemens often provides competitive bids, especially if the project specifies Siemens or if Siemens has an incumbent relationship. They will adjust margins to win large projects (sometimes taking lower upfront profit expecting service revenue later [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=The%20best%20buying%20option%20you,agreements%20for%20equipment%20and%20software) ). For smaller projects (say a 50k sq.ft. building), Siemens is often less competitive purely on price, as their product lineup and organization is geared to larger sites – however, they do offer smaller-scale solutions (Desigo PX controllers or even a simplified web-server for small buildings) to address that market.
- **Ongoing Maintenance/Service:** Siemens Building Technologies (through its branch network) typically offers **service contracts** for any Siemens BAS installation. Maintenance agreements usually include scheduled preventive maintenance, emergency support, and software support. The **annual cost** can be similar to other vendors: around **5–10% of the initial system cost**. Large campus customers (e.g. a hospital with Siemens BAS) might sign a multi-year service contract that dedicates a Siemens technician on-site part-time. Siemens service rates are premium – if not under contract, on-demand service calls and upgrades can be expensive. Thus, many customers opt for a contract to keep costs predictable. It’s worth noting that **proprietary Siemens systems** often *require* Siemens service for software updates or reprogramming. This can lead to relatively higher ongoing fees if one is locked into Siemens. However, Siemens has been moving toward more open protocols (their newer Desigo CC supports BACnet, etc.), which allows some third-party service in certain cases. Overall, expect ongoing support costs in line with peers – e.g. a $1M Siemens BAS install might come with a ~$50k/year full maintenance package (including on-site support), whereas a smaller $100k install might have a $10k/year support offering. These can often be negotiated down or tailored (for example, software support only vs full parts & labor).
- **Software Licensing Models:** Siemens’ legacy Apogee system and current Desigo system typically use a **site-based licensing** model. For example, **Desigo CC** (Siemens’ current building management platform) might have tiered licenses based on number of data points or subsystems integrated. A large site might require an **unlimited or high-point-count license**, which could be tens of thousands of dollars (often embedded in the project cost). Smaller Siemens systems (Desigo Control Point for small buildings) might include the software with the controller hardware. In general, Siemens does not license per-point in a granular way to the end customer – instead, if you buy a Siemens BAS, you’re buying the controllers (which come with their programming tools/firmware) and a front-end software package for the site. The front-end might be a one-time purchase with a certain number of concurrent user seats or workstation licenses. Siemens also offers an optional **software maintenance agreement** for Desigo CC which provides updates and tech support for an annual fee. As of 2024, Siemens has also been exploring cloud-based supervisory software (e.g. **Siemens Building X** platform) – these could be subscription-based if deployed, but for on-premise BAS, it’s mostly one-time licensing. In summary, **Siemens licensing** is typically **per system** (with different software tiers for small vs large systems) rather than a simple per-controller fee. Only authorized Siemens partners can obtain pricing for these licenses, but they are comparable to other top-tier systems. For example, enabling additional integrations (like integrating CCTV or fire alarm into Desigo CC) might require purchasing additional modules/licenses.
- **Hardware Pricing:** Siemens manufactures a full line of BAS controllers (field controllers for VAVs, air handlers, I/O modules, room thermostats, etc.). Their **hardware costs** are similar to other vendors, with many controllers in the few-hundred-dollar range each. For instance, a Siemens MS/TP BACnet VAV controller might list around $300–$500. High-end controllers (like supervisory controllers or integration controllers) can run a few thousand dollars (as noted, an Apogee PXC controller was about $7.5k list [plchardware.com](https://www.plchardware.com/Products/94/5407759/default.aspx?srsltid=AfmBOopg8VJ7SDtsniAm06Tke4cqvfIykLNrq62I9-xZppVW3RNticm_#:~:text=Siemens%20DESIGO%20Building%20Automation%20,00), though that is an advanced device). Sensors (temperature, occupancy) again are tens of dollars each (typical). Siemens uses proprietary firmware and programming (particularly in Apogee systems), which means the cost of *programming tools* is not typically passed to the customer (the integrator carries that), but it also means **third-party hardware generally isn’t used** in a Siemens system – you’re buying all Siemens-brand controllers. One hardware pricing quirk: older Siemens systems often needed a dedicated server/workstation that the customer had to provide or buy from Siemens; nowadays, Desigo CC can run on a standard PC, but Siemens might quote a turnkey server (with markup). Lastly, Siemens sometimes bundles field devices – e.g. their offering might include Siemens variable frequency drives (VFDs) for fan motors or Siemens sensors, which come with their own price but sometimes a discount package.
- **Notable Pricing Features/Discounts:** Siemens tends to focus on **large contracts** – for instance, city-wide or campus agreements. They might offer volume discounts or enterprise pricing if a client standardizes on Siemens across multiple sites. An example of vendor-specific practice: if Siemens also sells the **HVAC equipment** (via their mechanical division or partners), they might integrate the BAS at a favorable rate (similar to JCI’s strategy). While Siemens isn’t typically thought of for small-budget projects, they did introduce more **cost-effective lines (EasyIO/Desigo DXR controllers)** to compete in retrofit and mid-market – these are priced more aggressively. In competitive bids, Siemens will sometimes provide an **allowance for future expansion** (extra capacity at no extra licensing fee) as a selling point, arguing a better lifecycle value. They have also been known to offer financing or performance contracting (through Siemens Financial Services) where the BAS cost is amortized and paid from energy savings. On discounts: like others, **Siemens may significantly cut initial prices for a flagship project**, counting on long-term service – it’s not uncommon that the initial margin is slim, with the plan to charge for additions or service down the line [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=The%20best%20buying%20option%20you,agreements%20for%20equipment%20and%20software). Owners should be aware that **proprietary Siemens Apogee systems** can incur high upgrade costs later, so negotiating things like open protocol compatibility or pricing for future upgrades up front can save money. In recent years, Siemens has made moves toward **openness (BACnet/SC)** and even **integration with competing systems**, which could give customers more flexibility and potentially better pricing (since one could integrate third-party devices on a Siemens front-end if needed).

### Johnson Controls (JCI)

- **Initial Installation Costs:** Johnson Controls is a major BAS provider with its **Metasys** platform, and also offers a Niagara-based line (Facility Explorer). Initial install costs for JCI BAS are on par with other top vendors. A fully installed Metasys system’s cost will typically fall into the standard range (e.g. mid-to-high single-digit dollars per sq.ft. depending on scope). JCI often bundles BAS with its HVAC equipment sales (they manufacture YORK chillers, air handlers, etc.) – in large projects, JCI may **discount the BAS heavily if the customer also buys JCI mechanical systems**. It’s noted in industry chatter that JCI (and others) will *“drop their pants”* on price for a big project to win the deal [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=The%20best%20buying%20option%20you,agreements%20for%20equipment%20and%20software), sometimes even bidding at very low (or negative) margins on the controls portion, expecting to make profit on future service and equipment sales. Thus, on a major new construction, a JCI initial bid might come in very competitively. For smaller standalone projects (like retrofitting a single building’s BAS), JCI’s pricing can be less aggressive. The Metasys system uses JCI’s proprietary controllers and typically requires JCI’s in-house technicians for setup – **only Johnson Controls techs or authorized reps can install Metasys software** [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/r/Metasys/en-US/Metasys-System-Software-Purchase-Options-Product-Bulletin/13.0.50/Metasys-software-package-details#:~:text=Only%20Johnson%20Controls%20technicians%20or,labor%20to%20install%20the%20software). This proprietary approach can mean the labor rates are set by JCI (often at a premium). Still, the **hardware costs** and base software costs are similar to peers. For example, a JCI field controller (FAC, VMA series, etc.) might be a few hundred dollars like competitors; a Metasys server software package might be on the order of $5k–$15k (varies with size). Summarily, expect JCI initial quotes to align with market averages – e.g. a 200k sq.ft. building could be in the ~$500k range – with possible better deals if part of a larger JCI scope or long-term client agreement.
- **Ongoing Maintenance/Service Fees:** Johnson Controls strongly encourages service contracts for their BAS. Many Metasys installations are maintained by JCI’s service branch. **Maintenance fees** often include software upgrades, phone support, and on-site visits. JCI’s service pricing can be relatively **high** if you purchase à la carte; hence they bundle it. For example, one public-sector client reported paying about **$20,000 per year** in total to service 5 buildings with JCI’s Tracer SC+ system (Trane was referenced, but JCI’s costs are in a similar ballpark) [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/184ygmr/total_cost_of_ownership_tco_of_a_jace/#:~:text=years%20thru%20public%20procurement%20processes,than%20the%20other%20two%20platforms) – roughly $4k per building annually. A different site with JCI’s competitor (Automated Logic) was ~$1.2k per building [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/184ygmr/total_cost_of_ownership_tco_of_a_jace/#:~:text=years%20thru%20public%20procurement%20processes,than%20the%20other%20two%20platforms), indicating JCI’s service was on the higher side. It’s common for JCI to shoot for **10-20% margins on service**; one industry insider noted service calls can target ~50% gross margin [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=Now%2C%20service%2C%20they%20will%20target,There%20are%20many%20vendors%20and). If a customer signs an extended service agreement (multi-year), JCI might lower the effective rate (e.g. maybe bring that margin down to 40% [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=Now%2C%20service%2C%20they%20will%20target,you%20a%20price%20that%E2%80%99s%20reasonable) ). In practical terms, for a mid-sized building, a JCI **service contract** might cost on the order of **$5k–$15k per year** depending on coverage. This could include an allotment of technician hours, emergency support, and minor software updates. Metasys software **upgrades** often require a contract or a paid upgrade fee – JCI historically has charged for major version upgrades of Metasys (unless covered by a subscription). It’s worth noting that some JCI customers choose to not renew support and run the system as-is to save money; however, that can lead to outdated software over time. JCI also offers remote monitoring services (for an added fee) where they will monitor alarms and performance. In summary, JCI’s ongoing fees are significant and should be budgeted – roughly **5–10% of initial cost yearly** is a reasonable planning figure, aligning with industry norms.
- **Software Licensing Models:** Johnson Controls’ **Metasys** software has traditionally been a one-time purchase per site (with optional maintenance). A Metasys installation consists of server software (ADS/ADX) and device controllers. JCI typically charges for the server software (based on features and capacity – number of clients, trends, etc.) and the field controllers are purchased outright. Unlike Niagara, Metasys licensing isn’t “per point” to the end user, but effectively the cost of adding more controllers/points is the cost of buying more JCI hardware and possibly moving to a larger class of server software. JCI recently introduced **Metasys SaaS** and **subscription** options (site subscriptions) [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/r/Metasys/en-US/Metasys-System-Software-Purchase-Options-Product-Bulletin/13.0.50/Metasys-software-package-details#:~:text=See%20the%20various%20tables%20under,site%20subscription%20Metasys%20software%20packages), allowing customers to pay a recurring fee for the software and support instead of a big upfront license. This model in 2024 is an emerging option – essentially **“Metasys as a Service”**. Traditional Metasys licensing involves *CALs* (client access licenses) for Web clients and optional add-ons, but these are handled by the installer. Because Metasys is proprietary, you generally don’t buy licenses separately; you buy a complete system. **Johnson Controls Facility Explorer (FX)**, which is their Niagara-based line, uses the standard Niagara licensing (per device & point). For FX, JCI might sell a package like an FX Appliance or JACE with X points licensed. In either case, JCI’s **software costs** are often embedded in the project – e.g. a Metasys software package might be quoted at, say, $10k, but marked up to $20k when sold to the customer [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=To%20give%20more%20insight,You%20can%20negotiate%20this%20price) (one discussion noted JCI might pay ~$1k for a software license internally and resell for ~$2k [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=To%20give%20more%20insight,You%20can%20negotiate%20this%20price), indicating about 100% markup common on software). **Licensing structure summary:** Metasys = per site (with tiers by system size); FX/Niagara = per controller & point; and new subscription models offer an annual per-site price that covers licensing and updates.
- **Hardware Pricing:** JCI’s controller hardware (FAC series for air handlers, VMA for VAV boxes, etc.) is comparable in price to Honeywell, Siemens, etc. An average field controller might list around **$500–$800**. They also have wireless sensors and thermostats (in the low hundreds each). JCI’s **Network Automation Engines** (NAEs/NCEs in older Metasys) or the newer SNE/SGE (Server Node engines) can be a couple thousand dollars each. All these are typically bundled in quotes. Johnson Controls often gives **package pricing** if their equipment (like chillers or rooftop units) come with controllers factory-installed – in such cases, the controls cost might be hidden in the equipment cost. They also sometimes include the first year of software in the hardware cost. As for third-party device integration (BACnet devices that are not JCI brand), JCI may charge for integration drivers or interface modules. But as far as pure hardware cost, think of it this way: the hardware for a medium building (maybe 100 controllers, sensors, etc.) could be on the order of **tens of thousands of dollars** (maybe $50k for hardware), out of a $200k total – the rest being software and labor. That ratio can vary. Also, JCI’s hardware, once installed, doesn’t carry ongoing fees aside from maintenance; you own the controllers. **Proprietary vs open:** Metasys controllers speak BACnet, but they are programmed with JCI’s tools. If a customer wanted to switch systems later, they might replace controllers; this is why some choose JCI’s FX (Niagara) hardware, which is more open. In terms of **discounts**, JCI likely has a tiered pricing for integrators – branches get hardware at certain internal costs and mark up to client. From a buyer’s perspective, JCI hardware unit costs should be assumed similar to any BAS gear – roughly **$100–$300 per point** capacity when averaged (for example, a $800 controller that handles 8 points = $100/point hardware).
- **Notable Vendor-Specific Pricing:** Johnson Controls is known for leveraging its broad portfolio: they might offer **deep initial discounts** if you buy an integrated package of HVAC equipment, BAS, and even services like security. The idea is to be a one-stop shop. However, the trade-off can be **vendor lock-in** – Metasys is a closed system requiring JCI’s involvement for expansions and even for software installation [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/r/Metasys/en-US/Metasys-System-Software-Purchase-Options-Product-Bulletin/13.0.50/Metasys-software-package-details#:~:text=Only%20Johnson%20Controls%20technicians%20or,labor%20to%20install%20the%20software). This can lead to higher lifecycle costs if not managed. JCI has responded to customer pushback by providing alternatives (like the Niagara-based FX line and the OpenBlue suite which emphasizes interoperability). JCI’s **“OpenBlue”** cloud platform is a new offering that can overlay on Metasys for analytics; it is subscription-based, but that’s separate from core BAS control. It’s also worth noting JCI sometimes provides **enterprise pricing** for large portfolios (e.g. a corporation with many sites might negotiate a master agreement for Metasys installations at a standardized cost per site). As one insider noted, smaller accounts tend to get worse pricing, whereas big accounts get sweetheart deals [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20market%20and,CM%20will%20make%20the%20difference). Another JCI peculiarity is the **license renewal for software updates** – historically, if you wanted a Metasys version upgrade, you paid for an upgrade project. Now with subscriptions, JCI is trying to make that a smoother yearly cost. **Discounts**: JCI will often include a 1-year warranty and maybe 1 year of software maintenance free. Beyond that, expect an annual fee for any extended warranty or support. In competitive bids, JCI may also throw in some **free integrations or extra features** to sweeten the deal (for example, integrating a third-party lighting system at no extra software cost), whereas they might charge list price for those additions in a sole-source sale. In summary, **JCI’s model** is to sell the system possibly at low margin and then **capture recurring revenue** through service and upgrades – customers should plan for those future costs when comparing vendors.

### Schneider Electric

- **Initial Installation Costs:** Schneider Electric’s primary BAS platform is **EcoStruxure Building Operation (EBO)**, formerly known as StruxureWare (and built on the legacy of TAC/Vista systems). Schneider also offers smaller-scale solutions (they’ve introduced an **“EasyLogic”** controller line aimed at more cost-sensitive markets [engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/schneider-electric-unveils-affordable-easylogic-building-management-system-product-range-2024-03-07#:~:text=Schneider%20Electric%20unveils%20affordable%20EasyLogic,effective%20rate.%E2%80%9D%20says) ). Initial install costs for Schneider systems are in the same range as others – **mid-single-digit dollars per sq.ft.** for a typical project. Schneider often positions itself as a **one-stop for power and building controls**, so in facilities where they supply electrical switchgear or lighting control, the BAS might integrate those at a favorable cost. For example, a Schneider BAS in a new building might be slightly cheaper to integrate with Schneider’s own lighting control system (since it’s essentially built-in). Hardware and labor costs: Schneider’s installers (either Schneider branches or partners) will price the job similarly to JCI/Honeywell. The full BAS for, say, a 100k sq.ft. office might come in around $250k-$500k installed, comparable to others. They have been known to be competitive in retrofit projects – Schneider acquired many regional BAS companies over the years (like Andover Controls, TAC, etc.), and when upgrading those older systems to EcoStruxure, they might offer loyalty discounts. Conversely, if it’s a brand-new site, the pricing competition is similar to other big vendors. Overall, expect **hardware costs** and **labor costs** from Schneider quotes to mirror the market: hardware comprising perhaps 40-50% of the quote, and engineering/programming the rest. They will factor in integration complexity (e.g. connecting to third-party chillers via BACnet might add some engineering fee). Schneider’s **EasyLogic** line (if applicable to the project) could reduce initial cost – it’s marketed as an affordable BAS solution, likely with simpler configuration and lower-cost hardware (targeted at smaller buildings or emerging markets).
- **Ongoing Maintenance/Service:** Schneider Electric (through Schneider Building Solutions or its certified integrators) provides service contracts for their BAS. The **ongoing maintenance costs** are standard – around **5–10% of the system cost annually** for a full coverage plan. This would cover software support (Schneider issues updates to EcoStruxure Building Operation periodically), phone support, and on-site visits for calibration and troubleshooting. If the customer elects not to have a contract, they can pay time-and-materials; Schneider’s service labor rates are comparable to other OEMs. One advantage Schneider sometimes touts is that their system is based on fairly modern tech (EcoStruxure is IP-based, uses standard protocols), so some facility managers feel more comfortable self-maintaining after initial setup – although major updates would still need a Schneider tech or partner. Schneider also offers **remote monitoring services** (they have a Connected Services Hub) as an add-on subscription, which can be a part of a service plan. The cost for that would depend on building size and options, but it might add a few thousand per year. In terms of licensing maintenance, Schneider’s software maintenance agreements ensure you get the latest versions of EcoStruxure; these are usually a small annual fee relative to initial (maybe ~ **$1k–$3k/year** for software on a typical site, often folded into the service contract). Summing up, Schneider’s ongoing fees are **on par with industry norms** – clients should budget a similar percentage of capex for annual opex to keep the system optimized. Schneider’s large customers (like big campuses using Schneider for power and HVAC controls) might negotiate enterprise service agreements at a lower rate per building.
- **Software Licensing Models:** EcoStruxure Building Operation uses a **client-server architecture**. Schneider’s licensing is typically based on the number of **“packs” of points or devices** the server will manage. For example, a small building might use an Automation Server with a built-in 250-point license, whereas a large site might require an Enterprise Server license plus additional point capacity. The licensing can thus be seen as **per-point tiered**, though it’s often sold in bundles (1000-point package, etc.). Additionally, there may be licensing for additional concurrent clients or web access, and modules (like graphical editor, analytics add-ons). Schneider also has **subscription offers** for software in some cases – they have talked about cloud-hosted BMS options, but as of 2024, the common approach is still a one-time license. When you purchase a Schneider BAS, typically the software cost (for the required point count) is included. If later you expand the system, you might need to buy additional point licenses or an upgrade to the next tier server. Unlike some competitors, Schneider’s model isn’t a flat site license unless negotiated for a very large site; it’s more granular, which can be cost-effective for mid-size systems because you pay for what you need. **Per controller/device licensing**: Schneider’s field controllers (SpaceLogic line) don’t need separate licensing – once you own them, they just tie into the licensed server. In contrast, their **SmartStruxure Lite** (for small buildings) might have a simpler licensing (possibly free software with the purchase of hardware gateways). Overall, think of Schneider’s licensing as somewhat similar to Niagara’s model but specific to their platform: buy a server with X capacity, add modules as needed. Schneider’s reps can also offer a **software subscription (SaaS)** where instead of buying the software outright, you pay annually – this might be used in some cases to reduce upfront cost, though it’s not yet the dominant model.
- **Hardware Pricing:** Schneider’s hardware includes **SmartX/SpaceLogic controllers**, I/O modules, sensors, and user interface devices. These are priced competitively with other vendors. A typical SpaceLogic HVAC controller (say for an Air Handling Unit) might be a few hundred dollars ($400-$800 range). VAV controllers with integrated actuators might be similar. Schneider also sells wireless Zigbee sensors and room units that could be ~$100-$200 each. Their top-level “Automation Server” controllers (which double as mini-servers in a distributed architecture) can be a couple thousand dollars each, depending on capacity. In recent releases, Schneider has an “IP controller” series which can reduce the need for separate gateway devices. On the **lower-cost end**, the EasyLogic or SmartStruxure Lite controllers (like the MPX line or SE8000 series thermostat-controllers) could be in the low hundreds, aiming to bring down the cost per point. In practice, hardware cost differences between Schneider and others are minor; what often differs is **integration of power meters and electrical panels** – Schneider might include hardware to monitor breakers or energy meters as part of the BAS scope, given their electrical focus. These devices (power meters, etc.) have their own costs but sometimes get packaged into a project. For instance, adding a Schneider PM800 power meter might be $1k each, but Schneider could roll that into the BAS quote to provide a more holistic solution (monitoring both HVAC and electrical). If a client is using Schneider for both domains, they might see some cost advantage (one software system for both). Schneider hardware is widely available through distributors, but programming requires Schneider’s tools, so typically one buys through the integrator with markup.
- **Notable Pricing Models/Discounts:** Schneider Electric, like others, will adjust its pricing model based on the deal. They have in the past offered **performance contracting** (via their energy services arm) where the BAS is part of a financed project paid by energy savings. This effectively means the customer doesn’t pay upfront, but through service payments – a different pricing mechanism. Schneider’s **EcoStruxure** emphasizes integration – for example, they might discount the BAS if the customer also commits to Schneider’s electrical gear, or vice versa, to secure a broader project. They also sometimes run **promotions** for upgrading old systems (if you have a legacy TAC or Andover system, Schneider might offer a credit or discount to move to EcoStruxure). In terms of **license model innovations**, Schneider has shown interest in cloud-based deployment – e.g., hosting the BMS in their cloud and charging a subscription, which could appeal to clients who don’t want to maintain servers; the pricing for that would likely be per site per year, but specific numbers depend on scope (this is an emerging area). Schneider also offers smaller solutions for **retail chains** (wireless thermostat networks managed via cloud) which are priced on a per-site subscription basis (for example, a retail store might pay a fixed monthly fee for energy management). Those aren’t traditional large BAS, but worth noting as part of Schneider’s portfolio addressing various market segments. To summarize, Schneider’s pricing is **flexible**: they have the standard capital purchase model with optional service, but they are also pushing into subscription models and bundling with their other products. A customer might see a **cost advantage if they leverage Schneider for multiple systems** (power, HVAC controls, etc.), effectively getting a package deal.

### ABB (Cylon)

- **Initial Installation Costs:** ABB entered the BAS market by acquiring Cylon Controls. Cylon (now ABB Cylon) historically offered open protocol building controls and competed as a lower-cost alternative to the big four (Honeywell, Siemens, JCI, Schneider). ABB Cylon solutions are generally **priced competitively** – often slightly lower initial cost to win projects, especially in the mid-size building market. A Cylon system might undercut a Johnson or Siemens bid by some percentage, largely because of a different business model (working through value-added resellers and focusing on open systems that reduce engineering time). Initial costs for an ABB BAS would still be quoted in the same units (per sq.ft. or per point). We can estimate that for a given project scope, ABB’s quote might come in, say, 10-15% lower than a top-tier competitor due to leaner hardware costs or lower overhead. For instance, if a project is roughly $300k with a big brand, ABB Cylon might try to do it for ~$250k–$270k. This isn’t a strict rule, but ABB positions their BAS as **cost-effective and scalable**. They especially target retrofits where they can overlay on existing sensors or reuse wiring, cutting costs. On a small building, ABB Cylon might offer simplified solutions with fewer upfront costs (they had a product called Unitron and now ASPECT, etc., which can be economical for smaller sites). ABB also can leverage its broader portfolio (ABB makes VFDs, electrical gear) but they are newer to integrating those with BAS offerings compared to Schneider. As ABB is still expanding in BAS, they sometimes offer **aggressive pricing** to grow market share. That could manifest as discounted software or free training for the facility staff included in the install. Overall, initial cost from ABB (Cylon) tends to be **very competitive** with an emphasis on non-proprietary pricing – meaning they try to avoid large licensing fees and stick to mostly hardware + labor charges.
- **Ongoing Maintenance/Service:** ABB relies on a network of system integrator partners for installation and service (much like Cylon did). Ongoing maintenance costs for an ABB BAS are typically determined by the local integrator. In many cases, these integrators can be more **flexible on service fees** than a large OEM branch. For example, a local ABB partner might offer an annual check-up and phone support for a modest fee (perhaps lower overhead than a Siemens branch contract). That said, if ABB is providing service directly (in markets where they have a presence), their fees would be similar to industry standards. We can assume maintenance contracts around **5-10% of initial cost** as usual. ABB Cylon systems are known for their **“open” nature (standard protocols like BACnet/Lon)**, which means a building owner might have an easier time finding independent service if needed, potentially keeping costs down via competition. Some ABB integrators might also train the facility staff to handle minor reprogramming, reducing dependency. There isn’t a single ABB service pricing model – it varies by who installs it. But one notable difference: historically, Cylon offered a **5-year hardware warranty** (longer than typical) and emphasized low lifecycle cost. If ABB continues this, it means fewer expenses on replacement parts in the initial years. Also, ABB’s controllers are not tied to expensive periodic firmware fees or anything; once installed, you mainly have to consider software update support and general maintenance. If an owner has in-house capability, they could potentially manage an ABB/Cylon BAS with less OEM intervention than, say, a Metasys system – again possibly lowering ongoing costs.
- **Software Licensing Models:** ABB Cylon’s software (for example, their front-end called **Aspect** or older Cylon Unitron systems) tends to have a **one-time license** that’s often far less costly than big-brand equivalents. Cylon historically did not charge per point licensing in a punitive way – you would purchase an Aspect server software license that supports a certain size (maybe small, medium, large tiers). It could also be licensed per controller count. But the key is, Cylon’s philosophy was open connectivity; they even integrated with Niagara in some cases. ABB may integrate this further with their portfolio, but likely they maintain a **transparent licensing scheme**. They might charge, for instance, a flat fee for the supervisor software and then the rest is simply the hardware you add. No known “per device” fees beyond that. Some versions of their system might even run on a standard PC with no dongle fees, depending on the integrator’s approach. Additionally, ABB could potentially move to a cloud-based model in the future, but as of 2024, the common approach is a traditional license. The **bottom line on licensing**: If a project uses ABB Cylon, one would expect *lower software licensing costs* than, say, Metasys or Desigo, because ABB’s offering is marketed on being non-proprietary and cost-effective. That means **no costly recurring software subscription is mandatory** – you buy it, and it’s yours, with optional maintenance for updates. Integrators have noted that Niagara-based systems and others do have maintenance agreements for updates; Cylon had fewer such requirements in some deployments (though if using their newer web-based front-end, maintenance for updates would still be advisable).
- **Hardware Pricing:** ABB’s BAS hardware (under the Cylon brand) is often priced a bit lower than the big-name equivalents. A typical Cylon unitary controller might cost 10-20% less than a comparable Honeywell or JCI controller. For example, if a competitor’s VAV controller is $400, the ABB Cylon one might be in the $300–$350 range. This is partly strategy and partly because Cylon had a smaller sales channel. ABB might adjust pricing as they scale up, but likely they will keep it competitive. ABB also makes a lot of related equipment (drives, sensors via ABB or Busch-Jaeger, etc.), and bundling those could provide some savings. One key point: since ABB Cylon is BACnet-based, **their system can integrate third-party BACnet devices easily**. This means if a certain sensor or device is cheaper from a third party, an ABB integrator might use it to lower cost – something less likely in a vendor-locked system. So hardware cost for an ABB BAS can sometimes be optimized with a mix-and-match approach (as long as compatibility is maintained). As far as the main components: ABB’s controllers (now often branded as ABB FSM or Cylon FLX controllers) have similar price points (few hundred $ each). The supervisory devices (if any separate from a PC server) might be Niagara JACEs or their own controllers, which again would be in the low thousands. Field devices like thermostats, valves, actuators are commodity – ABB doesn’t hugely mark these up differently than others. In short, **hardware costs with ABB** are generally *equal to or slightly less* than traditional vendors – that contributes to the lower initial bid they can often provide.
- **Notable Vendor-Specific Pricing:** ABB’s strategy is to expand in the BAS market by emphasizing **open systems and lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)**. They often highlight that their solution doesn’t lock you into one service provider and can be updated or expanded economically. For instance, adding more points later may just mean buying more controllers (which are reasonably priced) without needing to pay a big license upgrade fee – a selling point versus competitors. ABB might also leverage its global presence to offer good deals to multinational clients (if a company has sites worldwide, ABB can be a partner in multiple regions with consistent pricing). As a newcomer (relative to the others), ABB/Cylon sometimes provides **longer warranties or free software tools** to sweeten deals. They have been known to provide the programming software to end-users (with training) so that clients aren’t forced to call the vendor for every little change – effectively a **no-cost/low-cost programming tool**, which is a pricing differentiator (many big vendors charge for their programming tool or don’t give it to clients). ABB also tends to avoid charging for “drivers” to talk to third-party systems – if it’s BACnet or Modbus, it’s usually built-in, whereas some others might charge for a Modbus interface module/license. In summary, ABB’s pricing model is **geared toward transparency and flexibility**, often resulting in a somewhat lower upfront cost and potentially lower lifecycle cost if the owner takes advantage of the open nature (competitive servicing, etc.). Discounts from ABB may come in the form of package deals (like if using ABB power equipment, they might include some BAS integration at a discount). Additionally, ABB might aggressively price first projects in a new region to establish a reference site – meaning early adopters could get a very attractive price in exchange for being a showcase.

### Carrier (Automated Logic)

- **Initial Installation Costs:** Carrier’s BAS division, **Automated Logic Corporation (ALC)**, provides the WebCTRL system. ALC systems are widely used in both mid-size and large buildings (office buildings, universities, data centers, etc.). Initial install costs for ALC are comparable to other major vendors. Automated Logic often sells through a network of dealers (many of which are part of Carrier or authorized contractors). These dealers price projects competitively with the likes of JCI, Siemens, etc. WebCTRL is a BACnet-based system known for good integration, so ALC sometimes wins jobs on technical merit, but pricing-wise they are not usually the highest. For instance, if Honeywell and ALC bid on a 150k sq.ft. building, their prices might be in the same ballpark, with ALC sometimes a bit lower depending on dealer markup. In one anecdote, **10 buildings running Automated Logic** had a total service cost of $12k/year [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/184ygmr/total_cost_of_ownership_tco_of_a_jace/#:~:text=platforms,than%20the%20other%20two%20platforms) – implying a reasonably economical setup initially as well. ALC’s hardware and software costs are packaged in their proposals; they typically include the WebCTRL server software as part of the job (no separate huge software license line item in many cases, it’s rolled in). Carrier may also bundle BAS with their HVAC equipment sales (similar to JCI): e.g. if you buy Carrier chillers or rooftop units, an ALC system might come integrated, possibly at a slight discount. ALC is strong in certain sectors like **data centers** and **airports**, and in those large projects they are competitively priced to undercut giants like Siemens. Overall, expect ALC initial pricing to land in the usual range (they don’t dramatically deviate from that ~$2–$5/sq.ft. rule). Sometimes building owners find ALC quotes a bit more straightforward with less nickel-and-dime on options, which can make them cost-effective.
- **Ongoing Maintenance/Service Fees:** Automated Logic’s service is often provided by the same dealer/branch that installed the system. **Maintenance contracts** with ALC are generally **optional**, and many customers report that ALC systems are user-friendly enough that they can reduce reliance on the vendor over time. That said, ALC dealers do offer service agreements similar to others – typically covering software updates, tech support, and an allocation of on-site maintenance hours. From the data point referenced, **10 ALC buildings were maintained for about $12,000/year total** [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/184ygmr/total_cost_of_ownership_tco_of_a_jace/#:~:text=platforms,than%20the%20other%20two%20platforms), which averages to only $1,200 per building annually – a *very* low number likely reflecting minimal service (perhaps just software support and a few visits). This suggests that ALC’s ongoing costs can be relatively low, especially if the system is stable and the in-house team can handle minor issues. Many ALC systems run for years without major intervention aside from occasional point additions or updates. ALC does release WebCTRL software updates, and a support contract or software agreement would cover those; these fees are modest (a few thousand per year for a large system, or less for small). If no contract, an owner might still call in service as needed; ALC dealer labor rates are comparable to HVAC industry rates. One factor that can keep ALC service costs down is that their system uses **BACnet throughout**, meaning an owner isn’t locked into only ALC for expansions – however, in practice most stick with ALC for consistency. In summary, ALC maintenance costs often come in at the **lower end of the typical range**. A full service contract might be 5% of initial cost per year or even less. Some customers essentially just budget a small contingency for repairs and skip a formal contract, relying on the system’s robustness.
- **Software Licensing Models:** Automated Logic’s **WebCTRL** software is usually sold on a per-server basis, with capacity for a certain number of devices (since it’s all BACnet, the “device” count can correspond to controllers). Typically, when you buy an ALC system, the WebCTRL software license for that site is included in the package – you aren’t separately paying per point licensing in a transparent way. ALC doesn’t charge annual licensing fees to keep the system running; once purchased, the license is permanent. If you need to expand, oftentimes you can add more ALC controllers up to the capacity of your server without buying new software. If you exceed that, you might need to upgrade the server’s device count license (which would be a one-time purchase). ALC also licenses some optional modules (for example, they have an EnergyReports tool or other analytics) which cost extra if you choose them. But their core model is fairly **bundled** – the WebCTRL server software, database, etc., all come as part of the system. This is a bit different from say, JCI, where you might see distinct line items for software. ALC’s philosophy is to provide a complete system including the front-end. Therefore, owners often perceive that there’s **no nickel-and-dime licensing** (though of course the cost is built in). ALC does not require regular license renewal, except if you want major upgrades (which might incur an upgrade fee or be included in a support contract). They have also begun offering some cloud-based services (like remote access gateways, or their new SaaS offerings for smaller buildings under the “ALO” brand), but WebCTRL for larger sites remains primarily an on-premise server/client with perpetual licensing. In essence, **ALC’s licensing** is **per site (server)** with capacity limits, but practically it feels like “buy the system and you have all you need”. No per-point costs are charged to owners explicitly.
- **Hardware Pricing:** ALC produces an array of BACnet controllers (the “SE” series for terminal units, “ME” controllers for equipment, etc.). Hardware pricing is similar to others – controllers in the few hundred dollar range each. For example, an ALC VAV controller with integrated actuator might list around $350-$500. A plant controller handling many points might be $800-$1000. One thing with ALC is that their devices often have greater capacity (since BACnet allows for bigger devices), so you might need fewer controllers in some cases (which can save cost). Sensors, actuators, and other peripherals used by ALC are standard (they might supply them or use third-party). The cost of a WebCTRL server (if provided by ALC) could be a standard PC with their software – some dealers include a industrial grade server in the quote, others assume the client’s IT will provide a VM or machine. If included, that could add a couple thousand dollars. In many scenarios, ALC hardware costs tend to be a bit lower total than a similar JCI system simply because of how it’s scaled – but it’s project-specific. There aren’t publicly available price lists, but hardware cost competitiveness is one reason ALC often wins in cost-sensitive bids. Carrier’s strategy might also allow bundling: e.g. if an owner is buying Carrier HVAC systems with factory-mounted ALC controls, those controller costs might be embedded in the HVAC equipment price (which can be a capital budget advantage). Additionally, since ALC is BACnet native, they can integrate other manufacturers’ BACnet devices (like maybe a cheaper third-party VFD), which could reduce overall hardware spend versus a fully proprietary approach.
- **Notable Vendor-Specific Pricing:** Automated Logic’s key differentiator is being **BACnet from the ground up** and relatively open. This means building owners have some leverage – the system can be serviced by any trained BACnet technician with WebCTRL knowledge, not exclusively by Carrier. This openness can lead to more **competitive service pricing and expansion pricing**. ALC dealers often highlight that the customer will **own their system without hidden fees** – for instance, WebCTRL has built-in graphics and tools that the owner can use (with training) so they don’t have to pay the vendor for every little reprogramming. This can reduce costs over time. In competitive procurement, ALC is known to be a **strong value**: not “cheap” but often the **best bang for buck** when considering both price and capabilities. Perhaps for that reason, we saw that maintenance example where ALC’s ongoing costs were much lower [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/184ygmr/total_cost_of_ownership_tco_of_a_jace/#:~:text=platforms,than%20the%20other%20two%20platforms) – indicating that after installation, the system didn’t require expensive upkeep. Another notable aspect: ALC sometimes offers **multi-year warranty** or a year of service included. Being part of Carrier/UTC, they can also be part of **bundled solutions** (like including a chiller plant optimization system if you buy Carrier chillers). In terms of discounts, ALC dealers have some flexibility in pricing; if competing against a lower-cost brand (like an Alerton or Tridium integrator), they can reduce their margins to win. They also benefit from lower overhead as many dealers are smaller companies. All in all, ALC’s pricing model is **user-friendly** – upfront cost is competitive, and ongoing costs can be comparatively low due to open access and fewer mandatory fees. Their **WebCTRL licensing policy (no annual fees required)** and **transparent upgrade path** are often cited by customers as positives that save money and hassle in the long run.

### Other Notable Vendors

In addition to the above majors, there are other significant BAS providers:

- **Trane** (maker of Tracer SC/ES systems, now part of Trane Technologies): Trane BAS is often installed alongside Trane HVAC equipment. Pricing is similar to Johnson Controls – Trane will discount heavily if tied to equipment sales. Ongoing costs for Trane’s BAS have been noted to be relatively high in service (one report indicated ~$4k/year per building for Trane BAS service) [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/184ygmr/total_cost_of_ownership_tco_of_a_jace/#:~:text=platforms,than%20the%20other%20two%20platforms). Trane’s software licensing is site-based (Tracer SC+ controllers with capacity limits) and they now offer a newer platform called Symbio and Ensemble, which could move to more software-as-service. Hardware-wise, Trane uses mostly proprietary controllers and prices are comparable to others.
- **Delta Controls** (Canadian-based, BACnet pioneer): Delta is known for very open BACnet systems and a worldwide integrator network. Delta’s pricing is usually competitive; they often come in slightly below the big OEM bids while offering a fully featured system. They use their own software (enteliWEB) with licensing per server, and no recurring fees except optional support. Maintenance is via independent partners, often making ongoing costs flexible. Delta hardware pricing is similar to ALC’s, maybe a touch lower in some cases.
- **Distech Controls** (part of Acuity Brands): Distech provides BAS and lighting controls, emphasizing integrated solutions. Their pricing for BAS (Eclypse controllers, etc.) is competitive mid-market. They often sell through system integrators. Licensing is Niagara-based (they are a Niagara OEM), so it’s per controller and point, with optional maintenance. Hardware costs for Distech (IP controllers, wireless sensors) are on par with industry, sometimes justified by advanced features (e.g. their Allure touchscreen stats). They may not always be the cheapest, but they pitch high energy savings.
- **KMC Controls:** KMC targets small to mid buildings with BACnet systems. They have straightforward pricing – hardware is often slightly less expensive, and their software (KMC Commander, etc.) can be subscription-based for cloud or one-time for on-prem. KMC often touts low total cost and ease of deployment (they even have IoT tie-ins).
- **Reliable Controls:** Another independent (Canadian) vendor focusing on mid-sized buildings. They have a reputation for low life-cycle cost and user-friendly software. Pricing-wise, Reliable’s controllers and software are generally cost-effective, and they also avoid recurring licensing fees for their MACHSystem.
- **Alerton (Honeywell)**: Alerton is a brand under Honeywell, but operates somewhat independently with its own dealer network. Alerton’s pricing is akin to Automated Logic or Delta – often a bit lower than Honeywell branch quotes. They use BACnet and have their own software (Compass). Costs and licensing are similar to the Honeywell WEBs model (one-time site software, etc.).  
	These vendors each have their nuances, but a common theme is that **open protocol systems (BACnet/Niagara)** tend to have **more transparent and sometimes lower ongoing costs**, whereas **proprietary systems** (like legacy Metasys, Apogee) might come with higher service and upgrade costs but are often bundled in initial project deals.

**Vendor Pricing Summary:** All major vendors break down project costs into **hardware, software, and labor**. Hardware (controllers, field devices) typically constitutes a significant portion of the install price, but much of the **value (and markup) is in software and engineering**. Vendors like JCI and Siemens often hide software fees within the project lump sum, whereas more open-system vendors explicitly show controller/device counts. **Labor** (design, programming, commissioning) is substantial – often 30–50% of the cost – and tends to scale with system complexity rather than just building size. When comparing vendors:

- **Initial $/sq.ft. costs** are all in a similar band, but vendors may reduce margins to win strategic projects (e.g. a big hospital might get an aggressive bid from Siemens at, say, $3/sq.ft. even if typical would be $5, because they want the marquee project).
- **Maintenance fees** are where differences emerge: some vendors (JCI, Trane) have historically monetized service heavily, while others (ALC, Delta) allow a more hands-off approach. Always consider the *total cost over 5-10 years*. A system that was slightly cheaper upfront could end up more expensive if it demands high proprietary upkeep. Conversely, a pricier open system might save money later by enabling competitive servicing.
- **Licensing models** vary: Niagara-based solutions (Honeywell WEBs, JCI FX, Distech, etc.) use *per-controller and per-point* licensing [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2); Proprietary ones often use *site-based* licensing (with upgrade tiers); and some newer offers use *subscription (annual per site)* licensing. Be sure to account for those – e.g. Niagara systems might require renewing a software maintenance agreement (SMA) every few years for upgrades, whereas a one-time site license might need a paid upgrade after some years.
- **Hardware unit costs** are not wildly different across vendors (a controller is a few hundred dollars from anyone), but vendors differ in how many devices you need (due to architecture) and their **discount structure**. A large order with any vendor will get bulk discounts (often project-specific). If needed, **mixing vendors** is possible via standard protocols, but it usually increases integration labor, so most projects stick to one primary vendor for the BAS.

In summary, **Honeywell, Siemens, JCI, Schneider, ABB, and ALC** all compete closely on price; none can afford to be far out of line in today’s market. The differences tend to lie in the details of licensing and long-term costs. For instance, an owner might choose a slightly higher initial cost for an open system to avoid being “locked-in” to high service fees later. Major vendors also sometimes offer **promotions or special terms** (e.g. extended warranty, training for staff, financing deals) – these intangible perks can add value that’s not immediately reflected in the price tag.

## 3\. Current Pricing Trends (2024)

**Focus on current (2024) pricing** – a number of trends and factors are influencing BAS costs right now:

- **Hardware cost inflation and supply chain issues:** The past couple of years saw electronic component shortages (microchips essential for controllers) leading to increased costs and long lead times. As of early 2023, semiconductor lead times were still averaging **26–52 weeks** for standard chips [jabil.com](https://www.jabil.com/blog/global-chip-shortages.html#:~:text=Why%20The%20Chips%20Are%20Down%3A,Later%20this). This has driven up prices for some BAS hardware (controllers, sensor modules) and caused project delays. Vendors have had to adjust prices upward due to higher component and shipping costs – industry estimates put **2022–2023 cost increases** in the mid-single digits percent for construction materials, and BAS components were no exception. By 2024, supply chain pressures are **easing somewhat**, but prices haven’t fallen; instead, they’ve largely stabilized at a new normal. Practically, this means the **high end of the $/sq.ft. range** might be a bit higher now than a few years ago (e.g. what used to cost $7/sq.ft. might be $8 now due to inflation). Owners and integrators also face longer lead times for certain controllers, which can add cost (expedited shipping, or temporary solutions). However, competition in the BAS market has prevented runaway price escalation – vendors are trying to absorb some increases or find alternate suppliers to keep bids attractive. Overall, **2024 BAS quotes include moderate inflationary upticks** over 2020 levels, reflecting global supply and inflation trends.
- **IoT and wireless technologies driving costs down (especially for small buildings):** A major trend is the rise of **IoT-based BAS** solutions, which use wireless sensors, cloud computing, and simpler installation methods. These have significantly **lowered the cost barrier** for small to mid-size buildings. As noted earlier, an IoT BAS might cost under **$1 per sq.ft.**[buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=building%20systems%20are%20non,based%20approaches), versus $2.50+ for a traditional wired BAS. Many new entrants and some established vendors are offering “BAS Lite” packages – for example, battery-powered sensors that avoid expensive wiring, or plug-and-play controllers that reduce labor. The result is **more affordable upfront pricing** for basic automation. Even the big players are adopting this: Schneider’s EcoStruxure has wireless options; Honeywell offers IP-enabled thermostats; Siemens has Desigo wireless room sensors. The trend is that **hardware costs per point are dropping** (due to cheaper sensors and commoditized controllers) [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=building%20systems%20are%20non,based%20approaches), and installation labor is dropping (due to wireless and simpler configuration tools). This trend doesn’t necessarily reduce costs for very complex large projects (those still need substantial engineering), but it does mean that the **average cost for a basic BAS in 2024 is lower than before for simple scopes**. It’s now feasible to automate a 30k sq.ft. building for tens of thousands of dollars (using IoT), which was unheard of a decade ago. So the market is expanding with **lower-cost offerings**, and vendors are adjusting their pricing strategies to not lose the low-end market to IoT startups. This competition is healthy for buyers – expect continued **price competitiveness for smaller systems**.
- **Cloud-based vs. On-premise pricing models:** There is a noticeable shift towards **cloud-based BAS software** and SaaS (Software as a Service) models. Instead of paying a large upfront license, building owners can opt for subscription-based services hosted in the cloud. **Pro:** This can lower initial capital costs (you pay a monthly/annual fee per building or per device). **Con:** It introduces a new ongoing cost (software subscription). In 2024, we see a mix – some vendors have introduced subscription licensing (e.g. Johnson Controls’ site subscriptions for Metasys, and Siemens offering cloud analytics) [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/r/Metasys/en-US/Metasys-System-Software-Purchase-Options-Product-Bulletin/13.0.50/Metasys-software-package-details#:~:text=See%20the%20various%20tables%20under,site%20subscription%20Metasys%20software%20packages), but many customers still go with traditional on-prem installs to avoid recurring fees. The trend, however, is moving towards **flexible financing of BAS**. “BAS as a Service” models, where all hardware and software are provided with a monthly fee, are being piloted by several companies. This is influenced by the broader IT trend and by customers wanting to treat BAS as an operating expense (OpEx) rather than a capital expense. For pricing, this means you might see proposals that say, for example, “$0.10–$0.20 per sq.ft. per month” for a full-service BAS package instead of a large one-time cost. We expect cloud/SaaS offerings to **impact pricing structures** more in coming years, but as of 2024, most core control systems are still sold upfront with optional service subscriptions. The key takeaway is owners have more options: pay now or pay over time. Vendors are carefully pricing these subscriptions to be competitive – often the **5-year cost under subscription vs purchase comes out roughly equal**, with the appeal being lower upfront cost and always up-to-date software.
- **Integration of more systems (but cost offsets through energy savings):** Modern BAS are increasingly integrating additional building systems (like security cameras, access control, shading, etc.). While integrating more systems can increase the initial cost (more points, more interfaces), many 2024 projects justify this via energy savings or operational benefits. For example, integrating occupancy sensors from security into the HVAC control can save energy – a **feature that might add cost upfront but reduce operating costs**. There are also regulatory drivers – new energy codes and carbon reduction mandates encourage comprehensive energy management. Owners are more willing to invest in features like advanced analytics, continuous commissioning, and fault detection in 2024, which do add to software costs (analytics modules, license fees) but promise ROI. Vendors often price these as add-ons or separate modules (sometimes subscription-based). The trend is that **smart building features are becoming more standard**, and while they raise the purchase price, clients are looking at the **ROI**. So, pricing conversations now often include the **value proposition** (“This $50k analytics package will save you $20k/year in energy”). This focus on **outcomes** somewhat shifts the discussion from price alone to life-cycle cost. Still, from a pure pricing perspective, incorporating these new features can nudge the cost toward the higher end of the typical range, but the decision is ROI-driven rather than a simple cost-plus scope now.
- **Labor and skill shortage impacts:** A subtler trend affecting pricing is the **shortage of skilled BAS technicians and engineers**. There is high demand for controls experts and not enough supply, leading to increased labor rates. Integrators in 2024 must often pay more to hire or retain talent, and this cost is passed on in project bids. While hard to quantify, some estimates suggest controls integrator labor costs have risen substantially (e.g. 10-15% in the last couple of years in some regions). This primarily impacts the **engineering and commissioning fees** portion of a quote. We’re seeing longer project timelines and higher labor quotes, especially in regions where the construction boom is stretching the workforce thin. Some contractors mitigate this with improved tools (standard libraries, remote programming), but complex custom work still needs hours of an expert. Thus, on sophisticated projects, labor cost line items are a bit higher in 2024. Owners might notice that bids for similar scope differ based on who has staff available – a contractor with a fully staffed team might charge a premium. Over time, this is pushing the industry toward more **standardization and remote services** to reduce on-site labor. But currently, if you have a complex building, expect labor to be a significant cost component due to these workforce challenges.
- **High demand and market growth:** The BAS market in North America is growing (driven by energy efficiency goals and retrofit opportunities), which means demand is high. High demand can support higher prices, but it’s tempered by strong competition among vendors. Essentially, **vendors have full order books** but still fight for each project – a scenario where we don’t see heavy discounting across the board, but we also don’t see unchecked price hikes. Market reports show robust growth and a competitive landscape. This means current pricing is relatively stable in that aforementioned range, with no huge swings – vendors are more likely to throw in extra value or flexibility than to slash prices deeply, given they have plenty of work.
- **Component technology improvements:** Newer controllers and sensors coming out in 2024 often have **more capabilities for the same or slightly higher price**. For example, IP-enabled controllers can handle more points than older ones, potentially reducing the quantity of devices needed. Also, **edge computing** features (analytics at the controller level) might come as standard. These tech improvements can make a BAS more powerful without significantly increasing cost, effectively improving price/performance. So while the absolute dollars might be similar, owners get more for their money now (e.g. more data, more integration, better graphics). This is a trend where the baseline cost hasn’t dropped, but the value has gone up.
- **Regulatory and compliance costs:** Emerging cybersecurity standards (like **BACnet/SC secure communications** ) are being adopted. Compliance might require firmware upgrades or new secure routers, which could add some cost. For instance, upgrading a BAS to meet new IT security requirements might involve purchasing new interface modules or software patches (often covered under maintenance agreements, but if not, it’s an extra cost). Additionally, some jurisdictions push smart building tech (for energy reporting, etc.), effectively making BAS less optional – this boosts volume but also can add specific requirements (like secure remote access) that come with costs.

In summary, **current BAS pricing (2024)** is characterized by a balance of upward pressures (inflation, labor shortages, more functionality) and downward pressures (IoT entrants, technological efficiencies). The net effect is that the **traditional cost ranges remain a good guide**, with perhaps a slight tilt upward at the margins. Owners have more choice in how to pay (capex vs opex), and savvy use of new tech can either save money (wireless devices to cut install labor) or add cost (analytics subscriptions) depending on what they opt for. When planning a BAS project in 2024, one should consider not just the base installation price, but also these trends – for example, one might allocate a bit more for labor and contingency due to supply issues, but also explore newer solutions that could reduce the scope cost. The competitive nature of the market ensures that **vendors cannot simply inflate prices** without delivering commensurate value; many are responding by packaging energy savings guarantees or using IoT to keep solutions affordable. As a result, owners are generally getting more capable systems for roughly the same dollars per sq.ft. as a few years ago – a positive trend in value if not in absolute dollar reduction.

| **Building Size & Example Use** | **Initial Install Cost** | **Cost per Sq. Ft.** | **Annual Maintenance** | **Notes (Use-Case Variability)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Small (<50k sq.ft.)**   *e.g. Small office or retail* | ~$20k – $150k (basic IoT solutions at low end; $100k+ for full BAS) [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=A%20building%20automation%20system%20,format%20stores) | $2.50 – $7.00/sq.ft. (traditionals) [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=A%20building%20automation%20system%20,format%20stores) <br> \* $0.75 – $1.50/sq.ft. (IoT-based)\* [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=building%20systems%20are%20non,based%20approaches) | Typically ~10% of install cost/yr (higher relative overhead) | High unit costs due to lack of scale. Many small buildings opt for **IoT or “lite” BAS** to reduce upfront cost [buildinglens.com](https://buildinglens.com/small-to-medium-sized-building-systems-found-to-be-a-huge-market/#:~:text=building%20systems%20are%20non,based%20approaches). Simpler uses (basic HVAC) at low end; complex small facilities (labs/clinics) at high end. |
| **Mid (50k–200k sq.ft.)**   *e.g. Multi-story office, school* | ~$125k – $750k+ total install (varies with systems integrated) | ~$2.50 – $5.00/sq.ft. typical [info.midatlanticcontrols.com](https://info.midatlanticcontrols.com/blog/how-much-does-a-building-automation-system-cost#:~:text=Image%3A%20Photo%20of%20a%20BMS,50) (office around $3/sq.ft.; hospital wing or data center up to ~$5) | ~5–10% of install/yr (average HVAC-focused systems closer to 5%) | Economies of scale start to kick in. **Office, hotel, edu** buildings in mid-range costs; **hospital, datacenter** uses push upper end due to more sensors & redundancy [info.midatlanticcontrols.com](https://info.midatlanticcontrols.com/blog/how-much-does-a-building-automation-system-cost#:~:text=The%20type%20of%20business%20also,its%20electronic%20equipment%20running%20optimally). Most systems (HVAC, lighting, etc.) can be integrated within this budget. |
| **Large (>200k sq.ft.)**   *e.g. Campus, high-rise, hospital* | $500k – $2M+ total install (very large campuses can be multi-million) | ~$2.00 – $4.00/sq.ft. typical [info.midatlanticcontrols.com](https://info.midatlanticcontrols.com/blog/how-much-does-a-building-automation-system-cost#:~:text=Image%3A%20Photo%20of%20a%20BMS,50) (can reach ~$5+ for ultra-complex facilities) | ~5% of install/yr (large systems benefit from scale; often negotiated contracts) | **Economy of scale** lowers $/ft, though absolute cost is high. Standard large **office tower** ~<$3/sq.ft.; **major hospital/data center** might be $4–$6/sq.ft. due to critical systems. Volume discounts common on hardware. Extensive integration (fire, security, lab systems) drives higher end. |

**Notes:** The above figures are general estimates – actual costs vary by project scope, region, and the bidding climate. *Initial Install Cost* includes hardware, software, and labor. *Cost per sq.ft.* ranges are broad to cover simple to complex use-cases. *Maintenance* is typically a combination of software support, on-site service, and warranty; some owners opt for less or more coverage. **Large projects often see discounted unit pricing** due to volume [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=The%20best%20buying%20option%20you,agreements%20for%20equipment%20and%20software), while **small projects have proportionally higher costs** [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildingAutomation/comments/1emvgrm/licensing_costs_for_bas_software/#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20market%20and,CM%20will%20make%20the%20difference). Vendor selection can influence long-term costs (proprietary systems may have higher upgrade fees, while open systems can invite competitive servicing). However, all reputable vendors deliver systems that can achieve significant energy and operational savings, often **paying back** their cost within a few years through efficiency gains. It’s crucial to compare not just upfront prices but also the **licensing model and expected recurring fees** when evaluating vendor proposals, as shown above. Each vendor’s offering has its pros and cons, but as the market stands in 2024, there is a solution at almost every price point – from low-cost IoT-based controls to full-featured traditional BAS – allowing building owners to choose the level of automation that fits their budget and goals.
