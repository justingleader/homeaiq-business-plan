## Integrated BMS Solution for a 20,000 sq ft Office – Johnson Controls Metasys

## 1\. Johnson Controls Metasys Software Platform

**Platform Overview:** The proposed Building Automation System uses **Johnson Controls Metasys** – a leading BAS platform that provides unified control over HVAC, lighting, security, fire safety and other building systems [latam.johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.latam.johnsoncontrols.com/en/building-automation-and-controls/building-automation-systems/metasys#:~:text=Metasys%C2%AE%20from%20Johnson%20Controls%C2%A0makes%20your,the%20way%20your%20building%20functions). Metasys serves as the central software **“single pane of glass”** for facility operations, enabling different subsystems to “talk” to each other on one platform [latam.johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.latam.johnsoncontrols.com/en/building-automation-and-controls/building-automation-systems/metasys#:~:text=Metasys%C2%AE%20from%20Johnson%20Controls%C2%A0makes%20your,the%20way%20your%20building%20functions). This integration means data and alarms from HVAC equipment, lighting controls, access control, CCTV cameras, and fire panels can all be accessed in one interface. For example, Metasys can display information from elevators, fire alarms, security/access systems, lighting and HVAC together [rtautomation.com](https://www.rtautomation.com/rtas-blog/moving-building-data-into-metasys/?srsltid=AfmBOoohBgUwV69jQh3GG5Za3_nBws9SrtkkxPfhOQq5CRBzxH-9eBBM#:~:text=In%20these%20situations%2C%20Metasys%20pulls,going%20on%20in%20your%20building), giving operators a holistic view of building status. The platform supports standard open protocols like **BACnet** (the primary protocol for HVAC devices), as well as legacy **N2 Bus**, **LonWorks**, and **Modbus** integrations [rtautomation.com](https://www.rtautomation.com/rtas-blog/moving-building-data-into-metasys/?srsltid=AfmBOoohBgUwV69jQh3GG5Za3_nBws9SrtkkxPfhOQq5CRBzxH-9eBBM#:~:text=ways%20of%20moving%20data%20to,approach%20to%20Building%20Automation%20networking). This openness allows integrating third-party equipment and utility systems. Metasys also supports newer IT integrations – e.g. an **API** for external applications and data exchange, and optional links to cloud analytics (Johnson Controls **OpenBlue** suite) for energy management and predictive insights.

**Key Features:** Metasys provides a full suite of BAS features: scheduling and **timed control** (for HVAC and lighting auto-off), real-time **monitoring** of equipment, alarm generation (e.g. fault alarms, security events, fire alarms), and historical **trend logging** for performance analysis. Advanced energy management features are built-in, such as an Energy Dashboard (providing consumption reports and KPIs) and demand limiting controls. The latest Metasys versions include a modern web-based user interface (accessible via PC or mobile) and analytics like **Potential Problem Areas** and Fault Detection diagnostics. The system’s integration capabilities extend to **security** and life safety – Johnson Controls notes that Metasys can natively incorporate fire alarm, CCTV, intrusion and other systems into the BAS interface [latam.johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.latam.johnsoncontrols.com/en/building-automation-and-controls/building-automation-systems/metasys#:~:text=). This means, for instance, a single alarm console could show a fire alarm from the **Simplex** fire panel and simultaneously initiate HVAC smoke control sequences, or allow an operator to see **access control** status (door alarms) without switching applications [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/r/Metasys/en-US/SCT-System-Configuration-Tool-Help/14.2/Insert-Menu/Integration/P2000-Integration#:~:text=P2000%20Integration%20,from%20a%20single%20user%20interface). Such unified integration improves incident response and decision-making [latam.johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.latam.johnsoncontrols.com/en/building-automation-and-controls/building-automation-systems/metasys#:~:text=Metasys%C2%AE%20from%20Johnson%20Controls%C2%A0makes%20your,the%20way%20your%20building%20functions). Metasys is known for its reliability – JCI advertises 99.9% uptime for the integrated system [latam.johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.latam.johnsoncontrols.com/en/building-automation-and-controls/building-automation-systems/metasys#:~:text=) – and supports IT best practices like user authentication, encrypted communications, and cybersecurity updates (critical for a connected building).

**Licensing Model and Costs:** Johnson Controls offers Metasys software under both traditional licensing and subscription models. A typical deployment for a 20,000 sq ft office would include a **Metasys server** software (called an ADS – Application Data Server, or the newer **Open Application Server (OAS)** ) and client user interfaces. In a perpetual licensing model, the owner purchases the server software (often scaled by the number of devices or “points” in the system) and can optionally buy a Software Maintenance Agreement for ongoing updates. Metasys **ADS/OAS** licenses are commonly sized by point count (e.g. up to X field controllers/points) and user capacity. Approximate one-time license cost for a mid-size building (hundreds of points) is on the order of **$8,000–$15,000** for the software server. For example, a Metasys OAS package supporting ~500 points might be around **$10k** (list price). Johnson Controls also now provides **subscription licensing** – e.g. 1-year or 3-year software subscriptions instead of outright purchase [shipserv.com](https://www.shipserv.com/ShipServ/pages/profiles/88209/documents/BMS---METASYS-catalogue-Johnson-Controls.pdf#:~:text=M4,the%20Potential%20Problem%20Areas%20widget). This can lower upfront cost; for instance, an OAS 1-year subscription (including support) can be purchased instead of a perpetual license [shipserv.com](https://www.shipserv.com/ShipServ/pages/profiles/88209/documents/BMS---METASYS-catalogue-Johnson-Controls.pdf#:~:text=M4,the%20Potential%20Problem%20Areas%20widget). The pricing model is quote-based and depends on the facility size – third-party analyses show Metasys software “starts in the range of $100-$500” for basic configurations (likely per building or per smaller modules) [selecthub.com](https://www.selecthub.com/p/facility-management-software/metasys/#:~:text=Metasys%20Pricing), but a full Metasys installation for a commercial building will typically be several thousands of dollars. In addition to the BAS server, each integration (e.g. linking a fire system via BACnet, or an access control system via software interface) may require **driver licenses or modules** which can add to software costs. For instance, a BACnet/IP driver is native, but a **Modbus integration** module or an **API license** might be an extra line item. Overall, for budgeting, software licensing (including the Metasys server, client UI, and any integration drivers) can be estimated at **$10k–$20k** upfront for this project size, or a few thousand per year on a subscription – a relatively small portion of the total system cost.

**Integration with IT and Others:** The Metasys platform will be installed on an **industry-standard server** (on-premise Windows Server or virtual machine). It uses SQL database for data logging and can integrate with corporate IT networks (with proper firewall rules). Johnson Controls also offers optional **OpenBlue Enterprise Manager** cloud software (subscription-based) which can sit on top of Metasys for advanced analytics, energy optimization, and portfolio management – this might be considered if the owner has sustainability goals, but it would add to annual costs. Out-of-the-box, Metasys will provide enough integration to **utility systems** like demand response signals (e.g. via an OpenADR client or simple contact interface) and **compliance reporting** (trending data to show Title 24 compliance, etc.). The system’s **licensing** can include multiple user seats – e.g. a few concurrent user accounts for facility staff are included, with ability to add more if needed (Metasys ADX editions support 25, 50, 100+ users as indicated by part numbers [shipserv.com](https://www.shipserv.com/ShipServ/pages/profiles/88209/documents/BMS---METASYS-catalogue-Johnson-Controls.pdf#:~:text=with%20core%20license%20MS,8) ). For our single-building scenario, a standard ADS/OAS (which typically supports ~5 concurrent users) is sufficient.

In summary, the Metasys software provides the integration backbone – connecting HVAC, lighting, security, and fire systems on one interface [latam.johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.latam.johnsoncontrols.com/en/building-automation-and-controls/building-automation-systems/metasys#:~:text=Metasys%C2%AE%20from%20Johnson%20Controls%C2%A0makes%20your,the%20way%20your%20building%20functions) – with flexible licensing (site license vs. subscription) and rich features for automation, monitoring, and energy management. The software cost will be a modest fraction of the overall project (perhaps **$0.50–$1.00 per sq ft** ), while delivering significant capabilities to the building owner.

## 2\. Hardware Components and Infrastructure

A fully integrated 20,000 sq ft office will require a range of Johnson Controls hardware across all subsystems. Below is a detailed list of major **hardware components** by subsystem, including example Johnson Controls product SKUs and current approximate pricing:

### HVAC Control System Hardware

- **Supervisory Controller (Network Engine):** This is the head-end controller linking field devices to the Metasys software. We will use a **Johnson Controls SNE Series Supervisory Network Engine** (e.g. model **SNE11000** or **SNE22000** for larger capacity). This device communicates on the IP network and manages up to hundreds of field control points (it succeeds the older NAE55 series) [shipserv.com](https://www.shipserv.com/ShipServ/pages/profiles/88209/documents/BMS---METASYS-catalogue-Johnson-Controls.pdf#:~:text=%E2%96%A0%20SNE22000,METASYS%C2%AE%20SUPERVISORY) [shipserv.com](https://www.shipserv.com/ShipServ/pages/profiles/88209/documents/BMS---METASYS-catalogue-Johnson-Controls.pdf#:~:text=SNE%20SERIES%20NETWORK%20ENGINE%20FEATURES,device%20capacities%20for%20integrations%20that). It also handles protocol integration (BACnet/IP, MS/TP, etc.). **Cost:***Approximately* **$5,000** each (MSRP). (For reference, an eBay listing shows a Metasys SNE model with MSRP ~$6k [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/itm/225627246087#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20Metasys%20SNE10501%20Controller,com%2F00%2Fs%2FMTAxN1gxNjAw).) We anticipate **1** supervisory engine for this building (sufficient for HVAC and lighting integration points).
- **Primary HVAC Controllers (Field Controllers):** Each major HVAC unit will have a dedicated controller. For example, if the building has an Air Handling Unit (AHU) or rooftop package unit, we’ll install a **Johnson Controls FAC (Field Application Controller)** or the newer **CGM (General Purpose Controller)**. These controllers provide I/O to control fans, dampers, valves, etc. One typical model is **MS-FAC3611** (with 36 points) or in the new line, **F4-CGM09090-0** (9 inputs/9 outputs) [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/api/khub/documents/v8gKvluotZs5_GTiiggr_A/content#:~:text=BACnet%20automatic%20discovery%20Supports%20easy,0). **Cost:** on the order of **$600–$1,000** per controller (depending on I/O count). We estimate **1** controller for a main AHU (~$800). Smaller equipment (e.g. a boiler or chiller, if present) would similarly get a controller.
- **Zone Controllers (VAV Controllers):** The office is likely served by multiple **Variable Air Volume (VAV) boxes** for individual zone temperature control. We will use **Johnson Controls VAV box controllers** with integrated actuators, such as the **CVM series**. A common model is **F4-CVM03050-0** – a VAV controller with an integrated damper actuator and differential pressure sensor (for airflow control), supporting 3 universal inputs and 5 outputs [southsidecontrol.com](https://www.southsidecontrol.com/f4-cvm03050-0-johnson-controls/product/148789?srsltid=AfmBOop3lRPnXkDrYnVO6Rjd9NyCa4ri1CIc0R9B927AltpbTxlwXC00#:~:text=F4,3%20UI). These controllers are BACnet MS/TP and integrate seamlessly with Metasys. **Cost:** approximately **$1,000 each**. For example, one supplier lists **F4-CVM03050-0** at **$1,036.48** [buildingcontrolsgroup.com](https://buildingcontrolsgroup.com/products/f4-cvm03050-0?srsltid=AfmBOopq4s_ikhADs7WkaNtGP69gp7E_eEYMNMhAE6eKf8ZJ1iKzUq8-#:~:text=Price%3A). We anticipate **~20 VAV controllers** (assuming roughly one per ~1,000 sq ft zone), totaling ~$20,000 for VAV control hardware.
- **Sensors (Temperature, etc.):** Every zone and major HVAC component needs sensors. For room temperature sensing, we will use **Johnson Controls NS8000 series network sensors** (wall-mounted thermostats). These communicate over the BAS network (or analog to controllers) and often include an occupant setpoint dial and occupancy override. A model **NSB8BTN240-0** (temp sensor with display & setpoint) is about **$132** [apexcontrols.com](https://apexcontrols.com/product/nsb8btn240-0-johnson-controls-network-sensor/?srsltid=AfmBOor1hLZvvRB41mBF2aM8fsj3cMQzWoAx13CjYAyMMQUoH4njsaH7#:~:text=NSB8BTN240,can%20be) each. With ~20 zones, zone sensors cost **~$2,600** total. Additional sensors include duct temperature sensors for supply/return air (~5 sensors at $50–$100 each), humidity sensors (if needed for common areas, ~$200 each), and CO₂ sensors for demand-controlled ventilation in large conference rooms (~2 at $200 ea). We also include an **outside air temperature sensor** (≈$100). **Subtotal for miscellaneous sensors:** roughly **$1,500**.
- **Actuators and Valves:** Various actuators will be installed to control dampers and valves. For VAV boxes, the actuator is built into the JCI VAV controller. For the AHU, we’ll use JCI actuators on dampers (e.g. economizer damper actuators) and control valves for heating/cooling coils. Johnson Controls offers damper actuators like the **M9106/9104 series** and valve actuators (VG series valves with VA actuators). We anticipate about **6–10 actuators** (dampers for economizer and VAVs, control valves on coils, etc.) at roughly **$150–$250 each**. **Subtotal:** ~$2,000 for actuators.
- **Mechanical Equipment (VAV boxes, etc.):***Note:* The VAV box units (the actual damper, box, reheat coil hardware) are part of the mechanical scope, not controls – but integration-wise, our controllers will mount on these. If needed, we can integrate the **building’s elevator or generator** via dry contacts or a BACnet interface for status monitoring, but those subsystems aren’t major cost items on controls (often just a $1,000 interface panel if at all).

**Networking (Controls Network):** The HVAC controllers will communicate over a dedicated **BACnet MS/TP bus** (RS-485) for field level, managed by the SNE supervisory engine, or directly over **BACnet/IP** if using newer IP controllers. We will run Category 6 network cabling or MS/TP trunk wiring as needed. A network **Ethernet switch** (industrial grade or a VLAN on an existing switch) will connect the supervisory engine, the Metasys server, and IP devices. We include a 24-port PoE switch ( **$500** ) to power devices like wireless access points or cameras, and a standard network router/firewall appliance ( **$500** ) to segregate the BAS network for security. **Subtotal (network gear):** ~$1,000. We will also provide an **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)** for the server and network (approx. $500, included in installation costs) to ensure reliability during power dips, as required by code for life-safety integration.

### Lighting Control System Hardware

- **Lighting Control Panels:** To meet Title 24 and provide centralized lighting management, we will install a **Johnson Controls Lighting Control Panel**, model **LP-3500** (or equivalent). The **LP-3500** is a programmable lighting panel with high-voltage relay outputs for switching lighting circuits [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/api/khub/documents/oDcc8QPUYj~RBp7mkcG2ng/content#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%C2%AE%20LP,life%20and%20a%20direct%20manual) [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/api/khub/documents/oDcc8QPUYj~RBp7mkcG2ng/content#:~:text=11%204%2012%2013%20Item,under%20panel%29%204%20Enclosure). It can handle up to 48 relays; our building likely needs ~20–30 circuits controlled (for open office areas, conference rooms, etc.), so a **32-relay panel** is appropriate. The panel communicates via RS-485; with an optional BACnet module it integrates into Metasys [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/api/khub/documents/oDcc8QPUYj~RBp7mkcG2ng/content#:~:text=match%20at%20L134%20Optional%20BACnet%C2%AE,Number%20of%20input%20expansionmodules), allowing the BAS to implement schedules or occupancy-based lighting control. **Cost:** approximately **$3,000–$5,000** for a 32-relay panel (including relays and enclosure). We’ll budget **~$3,000** for one panel covering the whole floor plan.
- **Occupancy Sensors:** To comply with California Title 24, **occupancy (motion) sensors** are required in enclosed offices, conference rooms, and open office areas >250 sq ft [lightingcontrolsassociation.org](https://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/2022/10/26/lighting-control-whats-in-the-new-title-24/#:~:text=24%2C%20Part%206%20of%20the,permit%20in%20California%20in%202023) [lightingcontrolsassociation.org](https://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/2022/10/26/lighting-control-whats-in-the-new-title-24/#:~:text=automatically%20turn%20On%20lighting). These will turn lights off when areas are vacant, and we will also use their status in the HVAC system (so the HVAC can set back in unoccupied rooms). We will use ceiling-mounted PIR sensors (e.g. JCI OLS-2100 series or equivalent). Approximate cost **$100 each**. Estimate **20 sensors** ($2,000). (Per Title 24 2022, offices >250 sq ft must have occupant sensing that dims lighting by 80% after 20 minutes of vacancy and then off [lightingcontrolsassociation.org](https://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/2022/10/26/lighting-control-whats-in-the-new-title-24/#:~:text=automatically%20turn%20On%20lighting), so these are critical).
- **Daylight Sensors:** Daylight harvesting is another Title 24 requirement for areas with natural light. We include **photocell sensors** (one per daylight zone, perhaps 4–5 zones near windows/skylights). These tie into the lighting controller to dim or switch off lights when sufficient daylight is present. **Cost:** ~$100 each; **5 sensors** ≈ **$500**.
- **Lighting Control Integration:** The lighting panel (LP-3500) will be networked to Metasys (via BACnet MS/TP or a gateway) [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/api/khub/documents/oDcc8QPUYj~RBp7mkcG2ng/content#:~:text=Optional%20BACnet%C2%AE%20MS%2FTP%20adaptor%20module,Number%20of%20input%20expansionmodules). This allows the BAS scheduling interface to control groups of lights (e.g. sweeping all lights off at 8pm) and to coordinate with security (e.g. turn on emergency lighting on alarm). The LP-3500 panel itself has local override switches and LED status, and we will program it per the lighting design. We assume the building’s light fixtures (LED fixtures, dimming ballasts, etc.) are in place – our scope is to provide the control relays and sensors. If dimming control is required, we might add 0-10V dimming modules or integrate with a DALI interface (which could add ~$1,000 for a DALI gateway module). For now, we assume on/off control with multi-level stepped switching as needed for code.

### Access Control and Security System Hardware

- **Access Control Panel:** For the office’s **access control**, we’ll deploy a Johnson Controls (Tyco) access control system. Johnson Controls’ portfolio includes the **P2000 Security Management System** and **Software House C•CURE 9000**. For hardware, a suitable choice is the **Kantech KT-400** Ethernet Controller (Kantech is a JCI brand for access hardware). The **KT-400** supports up to 4 doors (readers and strikes) per panel and communicates via IP. We will need enough capacity for all entry points; assuming **8 controlled doors** (e.g. building entrance, secondary entrances, server room, etc.), we will use **2× KT-400 panels**. **Cost:** MSRP ~$2,600, with street price about **$1,387** each [dwg.us](https://dwg.us/ecommerce/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=55789&idcategory=8864&srsltid=AfmBOopSg2Qr18517eaGS0U0-tAD-1FxeXz7huBbkH5OJ705Wo_fkiGJ#:~:text=KT,controller%20that%20provides%20128). Two panels total **≈ $2,774**. (Alternatively, JCI could supply Mercury-based hardware under the P2000 system. Mercury MR series controllers cost similar ~$1k per 2 doors. The KT-400 is a convenient packaged panel for 4 doors.)
- **Door Devices:** Each controlled door will get **card readers**, door position switches, and electronic locking hardware. We plan to use **HID iCLASS SE card readers** for high security and compatibility (these support card/Fob or even mobile credentials). Cost per reader is roughly **$150** [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/HID-R10-iCLASS-Reader-900NTNNEK00000/dp/B00KD0AEGC#:~:text=HID%20R10%20iCLASS%20SE%20Reader,Subtotal); for **8 doors = $1,200**. For locks, doors will have either electric strikes or magnetic locks depending on door type (average $300 per opening for hardware). Also REX (request-to-exit) motion sensors or push buttons for egress ($50–$100 each). We estimate **$2,400** for 8 lock kits and exit devices. The access control panels also may require **power supplies and backup batteries** ( $500 total for the system).
- **CCTV Surveillance:** The security scope includes **IP security cameras** for coverage of critical areas (lobbies, parking entry, server room, etc.). Johnson Controls offers **Illustra** cameras under Tyco/American Dynamics. We’ll use **Illustra Flex** 1080p dome cameras (or similar) for general surveillance. **Cost:** around **$200–$300 each** for a 2MP indoor dome. Assuming **8 cameras = ~$2,000**. For recording and management, we’ll implement an NVR software – Johnson Controls’ **exacqVision** is a likely choice (Tyco’s exacq is a VMS that can integrate with access control). An 8-camera exacqVision server (which could run on the same BMS server or a separate NVR appliance) license is roughly **$150 per camera** plus server hardware. We budget **$1,200** for VMS licenses and a small NVR PC. (If higher-end integration is needed, the victor Video Management System with **VideoEdge** NVR could be used, but that’s more for enterprise scale. Our solution aims at cost-effectiveness while meeting needs.)
- **Intrusion Detection:** (If required) A simple intrusion alarm panel or integration of motion sensors can be done. Often, the access control system covers this (door forced-open alarms, etc.). We won’t include a separate burglar alarm panel given the scope, but we will configure the system such that if needed, it can monitor motion detectors or glass-break sensors via the input modules on the access control panel.

**Integration & Networking:** The access control panels (KT-400s) connect via the IP network to the security management software (which could be **JCI P2000** or **EntraPass** software for Kantech). We will integrate the **security system with Metasys** by enabling data sharing – e.g. Metasys can read a “occupied/unoccupied” status from the security system or initiate actions on alarms. Johnson Controls provides integration where access events can be viewed in the Metasys UI [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/r/Metasys/en-US/SCT-System-Configuration-Tool-Help/14.2/Insert-Menu/Integration/P2000-Integration#:~:text=P2000%20Integration%20,from%20a%20single%20user%20interface) (P2000 integration to Metasys allows viewing access control objects on the BAS workstation). While physically the systems are separate, the software link will make them feel unified to the operator. The CCTV system will be on the same network (PoE switch powering cameras). We will ensure VLAN separation or a dedicated switch for security cameras to handle bandwidth. The camera video is recorded on the NVR; however, we can program triggers – e.g. when a door forced-open alarm occurs, the Metasys or P2000 system can pull up the nearest camera feed for an operator.

### Fire Detection and Life Safety Interfaces

- **Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP):** The building’s fire detection is typically a separate **UL-listed fire alarm system**. Johnson Controls (via its acquisition of Tyco SimplexGrinnell) would provide a **Simplex** fire alarm panel, e.g. a **Simplex 4100ES** addressable panel, to handle smoke detectors, pull stations, strobes, etc. The cost of a full fire alarm system for a 20k sq ft office is significant (often **$3–$5 per sq ft** ). For this report, we focus on integration: we assume a fire alarm panel is in place at roughly **$15,000** cost to the owner for equipment and initial install (this includes panel, detectors, strobes – likely done by a fire contractor). To integrate with the BAS, we will use a **BACnet interface module** on the Simplex panel (or an HS integration module) that exposes fire alarm status to Metasys. **Cost:** ~$1,000 for the BACnet interface module. This will allow Metasys to monitor fire alarm points (alarm, supervisory, trouble statuses) and more importantly, respond to fire events. During a fire alarm, the BAS will receive a signal and can execute safety routines: shut down HVAC fans (to prevent smoke spread), release smoke dampers, turn on all lights to full for evacuation, and override access controls (e.g. unlock fail-safe doors). These interlocks will be programmed in coordination with the fire system per code. (Direct control of life safety is done by the fire panel, but the BAS aids in *ancillary* actions like HVAC shutdown which are required by NFPA.) We will wire hard relays as failsafe backups (e.g. hardwired HVAC shutdown relay from the fire panel) to meet code, in addition to the BACnet software integration.
- **Life Safety HVAC Dampers:** The building likely has smoke dampers or duct dampers that must close on alarm. These are part of HVAC contracting but our controllers will interface to them (through relay outputs driven by the fire alarm). The cost is already accounted in actuators if any are motorized.
- **Stairwell Pressurization or Smoke Control:** If applicable (likely not in a small 2-story office), additional controllers would manage those fans. We assume not needed here.

**Summary of Hardware and Costs:** The following table compiles the major hardware components with estimated quantities and pricing:

| **Subsystem** | **Component** | **Example Model / SKU** | **Qty** | **Unit Price** | **Subtotal** |

*Table:* Major hardware components for the Johnson Controls BMS and integrated systems, with estimated current pricing. (Pricing is approximate, based on supplier listings and typical market rates in 2024–2025. Actual quotes may vary.)

The above hardware list covers the majority of system components. In addition, there will be numerous low-cost parts: cabling (Ethernet and RS-485 cables), enclosures for controllers, power supplies, panelboards, relays, etc., which are accounted for in installation materials. The design also includes **programming tools** (Johnson Controls software tools for configuring controllers) and possibly a technician interface (e.g. a **MAP Gateway** for wireless commissioning of field controllers, ~$300) – typically owned by the contractor.

It’s worth noting that the **Metasys system architecture** allows some flexibility: in a smaller building like this, the **Open Application Server (OAS)** software could potentially replace the need for a separate SNE supervisory engine. The OAS can act as both a BAS server and a field controller host in one, running on a PC [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/r/Metasys/en-US/Open-Application-Server-OAS-Commissioning-Guide/11.0/Open-Application-Server-overview#:~:text=Open%20Application%20Server%20overview%20,in%20a%20single%20software%20offering). However, our design separates the concerns: a dedicated hardware engine (SNE) for reliability at the field level, and a server for user interface and data.

Every piece of hardware will be commissioned and integrated so that, for example, an occupancy sensor from the lighting system can set the HVAC VAV box to standby mode when a room is vacant, or a badge swipe after hours can trigger lights on in an area. The Johnson Controls platform natively supports such cross-system logic. By choosing a single vendor (JCI) for all these subsystems, we ensure **seamless compatibility** – Metasys natively supports JCI’s HVAC controllers, and JCI’s security systems are designed to integrate (e.g. P2000’s integration to Metasys [docs.johnsoncontrols.com](https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/bas/r/Metasys/en-US/SCT-System-Configuration-Tool-Help/14.2/Insert-Menu/Integration/P2000-Integration#:~:text=P2000%20Integration%20,from%20a%20single%20user%20interface) ). This reduces custom interface costs and risk.

## 3\. Cost Structure – Building Owner’s Perspective

From the building owner’s perspective, the **total cost** of the integrated BMS includes software, hardware, installation labor, system engineering, and ongoing service. We provide a breakdown below:

- **Software Licensing:** The Metasys software license (ADS/OAS server) and any integration software is a one-time cost. As detailed, approx **$10,000** for the license is budgeted [selecthub.com](https://www.selecthub.com/p/facility-management-software/metasys/#:~:text=Metasys%20Pricing). In addition, we include the first year of software maintenance (often included by JCI for new systems) – this ensures support and upgrades. If the owner opts for a subscription model, this $10k is essentially their first few years of subscription. (For cost modeling, we treat it as a capital cost here.)
- **Hardware and Materials:** All control and security hardware listed in Section 2 sums to roughly **$75,000** in equipment value. This is the **purchase cost** of controllers, sensors, panels, wiring, etc., at typical market rates (i.e. what the contractor would charge the owner, including a markup). The owner will likely see this bundled as part of a turnkey project price rather than itemized per piece, but it’s useful to know that, for instance, the HVAC controls portion might be ~$30k of that, security ~$10k, lighting ~$5k, fire integration ~$1k, and so on.
- **Installation Labor:** This covers the physical installation (mounting controllers, pulling wires, terminating devices), as well as programming and commissioning labor. For a 20k sq ft building, installation is a significant effort:
	- *HVAC controls labor:* ~200 man-hours (for mounting ~21 controllers, wiring 20 VAV boxes, sensors, actuators, and hooking up the supervisory engine).
	- *Lighting controls labor:* ~40 hours (installing 25 sensors, panel wiring, functional testing).
	- *Security system labor:* ~80 hours (mounting 8 card readers, 8 locks, 2 panels, running cables, integrating 8 cameras).
	- *Fire integration labor:* ~8 hours (connecting interfaces, programming sequences).
	- *Networking/Server setup:* ~16 hours (setting up the server, switch configs, etc.).
	- *Programming & commissioning:* ~80+ hours (software configuration of BAS graphics, logic, tuning control loops, performing functional tests and owner training).
	In total, we estimate on the order of **400 labor hours** for the project. At an average billable rate of ~$125/hour (this rate accounts for skilled union technicians, project engineering, and contractor overhead), labor cost is roughly **$50,000**. This aligns with typical ratios – labor often equals or slightly exceeds the hardware cost in complex BAS jobs. (For comparison, an intelligent building installation of this size might total ~$160k with $15k in commissioning [bicsi.org](https://www.bicsi.org/uploadedfiles/PDFs/conference/2019/fall/GS_TUES_2.pdf#:~:text=BICSI%20www,OpEx), which implies labor+commission ~ $70k [bicsi.org](https://www.bicsi.org/uploadedfiles/PDFs/conference/2019/fall/GS_TUES_2.pdf#:~:text=BICSI%20www,OpEx). Our estimate is in that ballpark.)
- **Commissioning and Acceptance:** Included in the labor above is **commissioning** – verifying every sensor and actuator, calibrating, and demonstrating sequence of operations. In California, **Title 24 Acceptance Testing** must be done for lighting and mechanical controls (by certified testers). We include an allowance for commissioning/acceptance of **$5,000** (approx ~40 hours of an independent or senior engineer’s time). This ensures the system meets code and operates optimally from day one.
- **Five-Year Support Contract:** Building owners often opt for a **service contract** to maintain the BMS and related systems. We propose a **5-year service agreement** with Johnson Controls (or the installing contractor) which covers:
	- **Software Service:** periodic software updates (Metasys versions, security patches) and license support.
	- **Hardware Maintenance:** annual or semi-annual preventive maintenance visits to check sensor calibrations, panel battery replacements (for UPS, controller backups), etc.
	- **On-call support:** priority response if any system issues arise (e.g. a controller failure, or troubleshooting network issues).
	- **Training:** refreshers for facility staff, and help with reprogramming minor changes as the tenant’s needs change.
	The cost for such a contract is typically **10–15% of the initial system cost per year**. Traditional BAS maintenance runs ~$0.20–$0.50 per sq ft annually in value. For 20,000 sq ft, that’s $4k–$10k per year. Given the multi-system integration (security systems maintenance is also included here), we estimate about **$8,000 per year**, which is **$40,000 over 5 years**. This would likely be billed annually or quarterly. The owner could negotiate levels of service – e.g. a basic plan at lower cost, or a full coverage plan (including parts replacement) at the higher end. Our $40k assumption is a comprehensive support package to ensure worry-free operation.

Summing these costs:

- **Upfront (Installation) Cost:** Software $10k + Hardware $75k + Labor $50k + Commissioning $5k = **~$140,000** total turnkey installation. This equates to **$7 per sq ft**, which is within typical ranges for a modern integrated BAS (generally $2.50–$7.00 per sq ft depending on complexity [aceee.org](https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/eo-smart-buildings.pdf#:~:text=energy%20consumption%20and%20reach%20payback,2%20depicts%20energy%20savings%20from) ). Our system is on the higher end of that range because it includes lighting and security integration (not just HVAC). For context, traditional BAS for HVAC-only might be $50k–$80k for this building; we’ve added lighting ($~5k) and security ($~15k) and some economies of scale in labor by doing it as one project.
- **5-Year Total Cost (Life-cycle):** Adding the 5-year service $40k, the **5-year ownership cost** comes to **$180,000** (around $9/sq ft over 5 years). This includes effectively 5 years of warranty/maintenance, which is important for budgeting purposes.

The owner’s cost can also be broken out by subsystem if needed:

- *HVAC controls (BAS) portion:* roughly $90k installed (including share of server and supervisory).
- *Lighting controls portion:* ~$10k installed.
- *Security (access & CCTV) portion:* ~$30k installed.
- *Fire integration:* ~$5k (interface and programming; the fire alarm core system $15k is often a separate life-safety budget item).

However, because Johnson Controls can deliver this as a single integrated project, the owner will likely see a **consolidated proposal**. This simplifies procurement and may reduce overlap costs. The owner should budget for the whole, but internally they might capitalize part of it under mechanical (HVAC controls), part under electrical (lighting controls), part under security. We recommend treating it as one “Smart Building System” investment.

It’s important to highlight **energy savings and operational benefits** to the owner as part of cost justification. A BMS that costs ~$7/sqft upfront can yield **10–25% energy savings** annually [aceee.org](https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/eo-smart-buildings.pdf#:~:text=energy%20consumption%20and%20reach%20payback,2%20depicts%20energy%20savings%20from). In California’s high utility cost environment, this system could pay back in a few years via energy savings and improved operational efficiency (as ACEEE notes, these systems often pay for themselves in 3–5 years [aceee.org](https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/eo-smart-buildings.pdf#:~:text=energy%20consumption%20and%20reach%20payback,2%20depicts%20energy%20savings%20from) ). Additionally, integrating security and lighting provides intangible benefits in safety and user comfort, which owners increasingly value.

## 4\. Cost Structure – Contractor’s / Integrator’s Perspective

From the contractor or system integrator’s perspective, the costs break down differently (reflecting wholesale prices, labor costs, and margins). Understanding this helps explain the pricing above:

- **Wholesale Hardware Costs:** Integrators like Johnson Controls procure hardware at distributor or internal cost. This is typically **20-30% lower** than the list prices an owner sees. For example, a VAV controller listed at $1,036 [buildingcontrolsgroup.com](https://buildingcontrolsgroup.com/products/f4-cvm03050-0?srsltid=AfmBOopq4s_ikhADs7WkaNtGP69gp7E_eEYMNMhAE6eKf8ZJ1iKzUq8-#:~:text=Price%3A) might cost the contractor ~$800. The $75k in owner-priced hardware might correspond to roughly **$60k in direct material cost** for the contractor. Large manufacturers like JCI often have pricing agreements; for a project this size, the contractor might also get volume discounts. The Metasys software license could similarly be marked up in the proposal (the actual transfer price for a $10k license might be $8k). In security, hardware margins are often higher (access controllers and cameras could be 30-40% markup). Overall, hardware is a profit center: contractors will typically apply a **markup** on equipment (15% to 40% depending on competition and item).
- **Labor Costs and Burden:** The integrator must pay its technicians, engineers, and electricians. Suppose the field installer’s wage (fully burdened with taxes/benefits) is ~$50/hour. The contractor will charge perhaps $100–$125/hour to cover overhead and profit on labor. Using our estimated 400 hours:
	- Direct labor cost to contractor: **400 \* $50 = $20,000**.
	- Billed labor to owner: **400 \* ~$125 = $50,000** (as we estimated). This yields a gross margin on labor of about 60%. However, that margin covers the contractor’s project management, engineering design time (the project engineer who designs control sequences and graphics may not be 100% billed as a separate line), and business overhead (office costs, insurance, etc.). After those, the **net profit on labor** might be ~15%.
- **Engineering and Programming:** Often the contractor will have a dedicated engineer to program the Metasys system – setting up the database, programming logic, creating user graphics, and configuring trends and alarms. Let’s say this project requires 80 hours of an engineer’s time. That labor is part of the labor estimate but is a higher-skilled role. The contractor might value that at a higher rate (maybe $150/hr to the owner). Internally, that engineer might cost $75/hr. So there’s margin there as well. In our cost model, we rolled this into the labor $50k. A contractor might separate “installation labor” and “engineering/programming labor” in their costing, but ultimately it’s the combined total that matters.
- **Profit Margins:** For a project of this size, a **controls contractor typically aims for ~30% gross profit** overall. This means out of $140k revenue, their cost might be ~$98k, profit ~$42k (before corporate overhead). Our breakdown (hardware $60k + labor cost $20k = $80k cost, vs $140k billed) actually yields gross ~$60k (≈43%). This is a bit high; in competitive bids it might be tighter. It’s possible our labor estimate is slightly conservative (if actual needed hours are less, the contractor improves margin). On the other hand, if unexpected issues arise (e.g. extra troubleshooting, or work by others not ready causing delays), those costs eat into margin. Good project management is key for the contractor to maintain profitability.
- **Service Contract Margin:** The 5-year service agreement of $40k is often very profitable for contractors. The actual effort in service visits might be: two visits a year (16 hours total/year) plus a contingency for emergency calls (another 16 hours/year). That’s ~32 hours/year. At a technician cost of $50/hr, that’s $1,600 cost per year, or $8k over 5 years. Some parts may be replaced under warranty – but many components have at least 1-year manufacturer warranty, and failures in years 2-5 are not super common if the system is high quality. The contractor might also include software upgrade costs in that service – if a major version upgrade of Metasys is needed, they’ll spend engineering time to do it (perhaps a $5k effort once in 5 years). All in all, the service contract might cost the provider $15k over 5 years in labor/material, for $40k revenue – a healthy margin. However, it also ensures the owner remains a long-term customer. Contractors sometimes price service a bit lower to win the contract, knowing it leads to future retrofit work and a foot in the door for expansions.
- **Contractor’s Risk and Overhead:** The integrator will factor some contingency for risks (e.g. if integration with a third-party system is harder than expected, or if construction schedule changes). They also have overhead like project managers who coordinate with other trades (especially on a project tying into electrical (lighting) and life safety). In a **design-build** scenario, the contractor may have included a design engineering fee. In plan-and-spec (bid) scenario, they bid per plans but still need to do engineering submittals. All these are absorbed in the cost. The pricing we estimated would allow JCI (or an installing dealer) to cover these and still turn a profit if executed efficiently.

In summary, the contractor sees approximately:

- Materials cost ~$60k (marked up to $75k-$80k in bid).
- Labor cost ~$20k (billed at ~$50k).
- Engineering/PM cost ~$10k (billed within that labor number).
- Total internal cost ~$90k; billed ~$140k ➔ ~35% gross profit. This is a reasonable outcome. Industry benchmarks suggest integrators should target at least 30% gross margin to stay healthy [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialAV/comments/18q20ob/typical_gross_profit_margins_and_net_profit/#:~:text=integrators%3F%20www.reddit.com%20%20A%20100,If%20you%20are%20only). Large BAS projects can have even higher margins if proprietary (less competition), but since multiple vendors exist, it stays competitive.

For the security portion, sometimes security integrators have different markup practices (access control projects might use 50% hardware margin, for instance). But since this is integrated, JCI can optimize across.

The contractor also values **change orders** as a source of profit. If the owner adds scope (e.g. an extra camera or an extra VAV zone), those are typically charged at high unit rates. Our design tries to be comprehensive to avoid surprises.

Finally, the integrator may get **performance incentives** or penalties – e.g. if an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) were involved, but here presumably it’s a direct capital project. The contractor’s main incentive is to finish on time, on budget, and get a satisfied customer (leading to that service contract and future jobs).

## 5\. Other Critical Cost Drivers and Considerations

Several factors can influence the costs and design complexity of the BMS beyond the basic hardware/software:

- **System Architecture & Complexity:** A more complex architecture (multiple integration gateways, custom programming) increases cost. In our case, using mostly Johnson Controls-native components keeps it simpler. However, if the building had to integrate many **third-party systems** (say a different brand of lighting system, or a legacy chiller control from another vendor), we might need protocol converters or custom software drivers, which add cost. Each additional subsystem integrated tends to have diminishing returns – so we have balanced scope. We included only what’s commonly needed (HVAC, lights, security, fire). **Adding elevators**, for example, could add a cost (maybe a $5k interface for monitoring elevator status). **Integration with the utility smart grid** (demand response) might require an OpenADR client or similar – this could add a small cost (~$1k for a module) but is often subsidized by utility programs in California.
- **Cybersecurity Requirements:** As buildings become connected, cybersecurity is crucial. If the owner’s IT department requires special network design (dedicated firewall, VPN remote access appliance, etc.), that can add hardware ($1-2k) and ongoing maintenance. Johnson Controls offers secure remote access services – if the owner opts for a **VPN appliance or cloud gateway** for remote support, that might be an extra ~$1,000 upfront plus some subscription. Compliance with IT policies might also require **hardening** the system: e.g. changing default passwords, disabling unused ports – this is part of good practice (minimal cost) but if extensive documentation or penetration testing is required, the contractor might charge extra. Given California’s emphasis on cybersecurity for critical systems, we assume the system will follow JCI’s best practices (Metasys supports encrypted BACnet/SC on newer releases, which could be implemented if desired). The cost impact at this scale is modest, but if neglected, a cyber incident could be costly – so we allocate some hours in commissioning for IT coordination.
- **California Title 24 and Code Compliance:** Title 24 (California Energy Efficiency Standards) is a key driver of scope. The code mandates specific control strategies for lighting and HVAC that our BMS implements:
	- *Lighting:* As noted, **occupant sensing and multi-level daylighting controls** are required [lightingcontrolsassociation.org](https://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/2022/10/26/lighting-control-whats-in-the-new-title-24/#:~:text=24%2C%20Part%206%20of%20the,permit%20in%20California%20in%202023) [lightingcontrolsassociation.org](https://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/2022/10/26/lighting-control-whats-in-the-new-title-24/#:~:text=automatically%20turn%20On%20lighting). This meant we had to include occupancy and daylight sensors, increasing hardware cost and programming complexity. Title 24 also requires **demand-responsive lighting** (for buildings >4,000 sq ft, the lighting system must be capable of automatically reducing lighting power in response to a demand response signal) [lightingcontrolsassociation.org](https://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/2022/10/26/lighting-control-whats-in-the-new-title-24/#:~:text=24%2C%20Part%206%20of%20the,permit%20in%20California%20in%202023) [lightingcontrolsassociation.org](https://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/2022/10/26/lighting-control-whats-in-the-new-title-24/#:~:text=Required%20lighting%20controls%20include%20manual,8). Our design can handle this via the BAS: if a utility DR signal is received (through the BAS or an external input), the LP-3500 panel can dim or shed lighting per a programmed strategy. There’s a minor programming cost to set this up, but it ensures code compliance.
	- *HVAC:* Title 24 requires things like **economizer control** on AC units, **demand-controlled ventilation** (DCV) in high-occupancy areas, and automatic **setback schedules**. Our BAS covers these: we included CO₂ sensors for DCV and will program the AHU economizer logic (likely required since Los Angeles climate triggers economizer usage). The code also mandates functional testing – thus our commissioning plan aligns with the Title 24 acceptance tests for HVAC controls. There’s no significant extra hardware beyond what we planned, but compliance does add some labor for documentation and testing.
	- Additionally, Title 24 (2019 and later) has a requirement for **Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD)** for rooftop units – either the equipment must have built-in FDD or the BAS must implement it. Metasys has the capability to do fault algorithms (like detecting if economizer is not functioning properly). If the HVAC units don’t have built-in FDD, we might program some fault rules in Metasys to comply. This would add a little engineering time.
	In summary, Title 24 drives up-front costs by necessitating advanced controls (occupancy sensors, etc.), but those same features yield energy savings. Compliance is not optional, so our cost estimates have baked this in.
- **Scalability and Future Expansion:** We sized everything with some spare capacity (e.g. the SNE engine can handle more points than currently used). If in the future the building expands or floors reconfigure, the owner can add controllers or devices relatively easily. This is a value-add but also a consideration – if the owner knows expansions are coming, the initial design might include extra wiring or oversized controllers, which could add cost now to save more later. We assumed the building is mostly static.
- **Quality of Installation and Commissioning:** A critical intangible factor – a well-commissioned BMS will perform optimally, whereas a rushed job can lead to higher energy use or user complaints, effectively increasing the owner’s costs (though not in the contract, it’s operational cost). We allocated proper commissioning time. Johnson Controls, as an experienced vendor, also provides documentation and training, which is important for the owner to fully utilize the system they paid for.
- **Economic Factors:** By 2025, supply chain and inflation can affect prices. Semiconductor shortages have, at times, increased costs or lead times for controllers. We used current pricing, but contractors might add escalation or contingency if the project isn’t immediate. However, the competitive BAS market in Los Angeles (with players like Siemens, Honeywell, etc.) tends to keep prices reasonable within the ranges discussed.

Finally, the **value proposition** should be emphasized. While the integrated system has a substantial initial cost, it provides:

- Energy efficiency, ensuring compliance with California’s aggressive energy codes (helping avoid fines or retrofits).
- Enhanced occupant comfort and productivity (a modern HVAC and lighting control can improve indoor environmental quality).
- Improved security and life safety response (integration of access, CCTV, and fire alarms means faster reactions – e.g., when a fire alarm triggers, HVAC shuts off automatically and camera feeds can be pulled up for emergency responders).
- A future-ready infrastructure – the BAS is capable of adding IoT sensors or integrating new technologies (for instance, occupancy data could feed space utilization analytics, or the system could be linked to a **smart building cloud** for continuous commissioning).

In terms of **benchmarking cost**, our integrated solution at ~$7–9/sqft including 5-year support is within expected range for a **comprehensive smart building system** in 2025. Traditional separate systems might each cost $2–3/sqft, so three separate systems (HVAC, lighting, security) could be $6–9/sqft anyway – by integrating, we not only stay in that range but also provide additional value. A study by ACEEE notes conventional BAS installations range $1.50–$7.00 per sq ft [aceee.org](https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/eo-smart-buildings.pdf#:~:text=energy%20consumption%20and%20reach%20payback,2%20depicts%20energy%20savings%20from); given ours also covers security, the economics are sound.

**Conclusion:** The Johnson Controls BMS (Metasys) with integrated HVAC, lighting, access control, fire safety, and energy management is a significant yet worthy investment for a 20,000 sq ft Los Angeles office. The design leverages JCI’s latest hardware and software (Metasys 11/OpenBlue) to ensure all subsystems work in concert. While the initial outlay is around $140k, the owner receives a state-of-the-art smart building platform that meets strict California codes, simplifies facility operations, and is positioned to deliver energy and operational savings that can offset the costs over time [aceee.org](https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/eo-smart-buildings.pdf#:~:text=energy%20consumption%20and%20reach%20payback,2%20depicts%20energy%20savings%20from). Both the owner and contractor stand to benefit – the owner in long-term value and efficiency, and the contractor by delivering a successful project with ongoing service opportunities. With clear headers for each subsystem, detailed financial breakdowns, and careful consideration of code and cyber requirements, this report serves as a comprehensive plan for implementing the integrated Johnson Controls BMS.
