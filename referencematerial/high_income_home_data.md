I will refine the estimates to reflect the entire metropolitan area, not just city limits. This will involve using metro-wide Census and ACS data to adjust for homeownership rates and high-income household distribution. I'll notify you once the updated numbers are ready.

## **High-Income Homeowners in Major U.S. Metropolitan Areas**

**(Owner-Occupied Homes with Household Incomes in Top 30% Nationwide)**

To approximate the top 30% income bracket, we consider households earning roughly above the 70th percentile of U.S. income (approximately **$130,000+** annual income ([Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation | Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60915#:~:text=of%20VA%27s%20disability%20compensation,Above%20the))). The table below provides **metro-wide** estimates of the number of owner-occupied homes in each metropolitan area where the household income falls in this top 30% range. These estimates are derived from American Community Survey (ACS) data on total owner-occupied units and income distribution, adjusted for each metro’s median income level.
