We've completed the comprehensive competitive response strategy document, implementing all elements of the reorganization plan. This document now presents HomeAIQ's competitive positioning in a clear, strategic manner that aligns with our business vision as an open ecosystem integrator.

### Key Accomplishments

2. **Competitive Landscape Analysis**:
   - Segmented the true competitive landscape into six distinct categories:
     - Legacy Manufacturer Dealers (Control4, Crestron, Savant)

     - Future-Forward Conglomerates (Bravas, Elevated Integration)
     - Individual Installers
     - DIY Market
   - Detailed business models, strengths, and vulnerabilities for each competitor type
