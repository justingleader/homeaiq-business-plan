# Capital-Efficient Expansion with Milestone-Based Funding
*CONFIDENTIAL - March 22, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines HomeAIQ's revised capital-efficient, milestone-based funding approach designed to reduce investor risk while strategically deploying capital only after key business model validations.

This approach aligns investor confidence with demonstrated execution while providing clear visibility into the company's progress.
