# Commercial Market Segmentation

## BusinessAIQ Market Opportunity

The commercial building automation market represents a massive opportunity, particularly in the underserved small-to-mid-size segment. Key market characteristics include:

* **Market Gap**: 80-90% of buildings under 50,000 sq ft lack any building automation system (BMS)
* **Cost Barrier**: Traditional BMS solutions cost $2.50-$7.00+ per square foot, prohibitive for smaller facilities
* **Energy Savings Potential**: Smart controls can reduce energy consumption by 20-30%
* **Operational Benefits**: Automated systems reduce staff time, improve occupant comfort, and enhance security
* **Regulatory Pressure**: Increasing energy codes and sustainability mandates driving demand

BusinessAIQ addresses this opportunity by leveraging the HomeAIQ infrastructure and AIQ Hub platform to deliver right-sized automation solutions at disruptive price points (targeting <$1.50/sq ft).
