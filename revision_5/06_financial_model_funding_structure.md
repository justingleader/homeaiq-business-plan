### Revenue Mix Evolution
Our business model will shift from predominantly hardware and installation to a balanced mix including significant recurring revenue:

| Revenue Stream      | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Year 7 |
|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Hardware Sales      | 60%    | 55%    | 50%    | 45%    |
| Installation Services| 30%    | 28%    | 27%    | 25%    |
| Support & Monitoring| 8%     | 14%    | 20%    | 25%    |
| Referrals & Other   | 2%     | 3%     | 3%     | 5%     |

This shift toward recurring revenue enhances business stability, valuation multiples, and long-term customer relationships.

* Series B: 2-2.5x return over 2.5 years (30-45% IRR)

## Capital Allocation Strategy

The dual-brand strategy requires thoughtful capital allocation to maximize returns. Our framework prioritizes:

1. **Core Infrastructure** (35% of capital)
   * AIQ Hub platform development (shared across brands)
   * Central operations and support capabilities
   * Shared back-office functions and systems

2. **HomeAIQ Expansion** (40% of capital)
   * Market entry costs (acquisitions, office setup)
   * Residential-specific product development
   * Marketing and channel partnerships
   * Working capital for projects

3. **BusinessAIQ Development** (25% of capital)
   * Commercial protocol R&D
   * Vertical-specific solutions
   * Commercial sales and marketing
   * BusinessAIQ-specific partnerships

This allocation evolves over time, with BusinessAIQ receiving increasing investment as its model is proven and scaled.

## Financial Risk Management

Several mechanisms mitigate financial risk:

1. **Acquisition Integration Model**
   * Structured earnouts tied to retention and performance
   * Standardized system migration playbook
   * Staged rebranding and business model transition
   * Preservation of key client relationships and staff

2. **Working Capital Management**
   * 30-50% project deposits from customers
   * Just-in-time inventory model with distribution partners
   * Factoring/financing options for large commercial projects
   * Vendor payment terms aligned with project timelines

3. **Market Expansion Controls**
   * Each new market must meet ROI and payback thresholds
   * Capital allocation tied to market performance metrics
   * Ability to pause expansion if economic conditions warrant
   * Structured stage-gates for BusinessAIQ launch in each market

4. **Recession Resilience Planning**
   * Focus on recurring revenue growth
   * Diversification across customer segments
   * Service offerings supporting existing installations
   * Energy savings focus during economic downturns

This disciplined financial approach, combined with the milestone-based funding structure, provides a clear path to building a $300M+ revenue business with strong profitability and attractive investor returns.
