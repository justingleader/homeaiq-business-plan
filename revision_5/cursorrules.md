# Revision 5 - Business Plan Enhancement with Dual-Brand Strategy

## Overview
This revision builds upon Revision 4 by further refining the dual-brand strategy (HomeAIQ and BusinessAIQ) with clearer brand architecture, enhanced technology platform definitions, formalized market expansion strategy, and optimized operational frameworks.

## Document Management Instructions
When adding new sections that should be inserted between existing numbered sections, use decimal numbering (e.g., 2.5_new_section.md). This allows for:
- Maintaining the logical order of documents
- Preserving existing document references
- Easily identifying where new content fits in the overall structure

Example: To add a section between sections 2 and 3, name the file `2.5_section_name.md` and reference it in this index.
