**Table 1 – Selected Major Mergers & Acquisitions in BAS (2015–2024).***Sources: company press releases and news reports.*[johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/media-center/news/press-releases/2022/01/12/johnson-controls-acquires-foghorn#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20acquires%20FogHorn%2C%20expanding,completed%20the%20acquisition%20of%20FogHorn) [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/honeywell-to-pay-nearly-usd5b-for-carrier-security-unit-to-boost-building-automation-products-8413387#:~:text=,its%20businesses%20announced%20in%20October)

As shown above, **Honeywell, Johnson Controls, and Siemens** have been especially active:

- **Honeywell** has steadily expanded its Building Technologies segment via M&A. In the early 2010s it acquired controls firms like Inncom (hospitality automation) and Saia Burgess Controls [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell#:~:text=2013%20%20Saia%20Burgess%20Controls,147%20%5D%20SPS). In recent years, Honeywell focused on fire, security, and software: e.g. acquiring **SCAME Sistemi** (fire systems, 2017) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell#:~:text=2018%20%20Transnorm,130%20%5D%20SPS), **Sine** (visitor management SaaS, 2020) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell#:~:text=BA%202021%20%20Sparta%20Systems,123%20%5D%20BA), and most notably, in late 2023 Honeywell agreed to purchase **Carrier’s Global Access Solutions** business (which includes LenelS2 and Onity access control systems) for $4.95 billion [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/honeywell-to-pay-nearly-usd5b-for-carrier-security-unit-to-boost-building-automation-products-8413387#:~:text=,its%20businesses%20announced%20in%20October). This 2024 deal – Honeywell’s largest in BAS to date – bolsters its security and cloud-based services, aligning with Honeywell’s strategy to lead in “automation, \[building\] digitalization and cloud solutions” [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/honeywell-to-pay-nearly-usd5b-for-carrier-security-unit-to-boost-building-automation-products-8413387#:~:text=Honeywell%20explained%20that%20the%20purchase,based%20services%20and%20solutions.%E2%80%9D).
- **Johnson Controls (JCI)** transformed itself with the 2016 **Tyco International** merger, combining JCI’s HVAC/control systems with Tyco’s fire and security offerings [johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/media-center/news/press-releases/2022/01/12/johnson-controls-acquires-foghorn#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20acquires%20FogHorn%2C%20expanding,completed%20the%20acquisition%20of%20FogHorn). Since then JCI has acquired several tech firms to accelerate its **OpenBlue** smart buildings platform. Examples include **FogHorn** (Edge AI analytics, 2022) [johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/media-center/news/press-releases/2022/01/12/johnson-controls-acquires-foghorn#:~:text=CORK%2C%20Ireland%2C%20Jan,IoT%29%20solutions), **Tempered Networks** (cybersecurity for building networks, 2022) [johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/media-center/news/press-releases/2022/06/23/johnson-controls-acquires-tempered-networks#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20acquires%20Tempered%20Networks,trust%20based%20Airwall%20technology), and **FM:Systems** (workplace/occupancy software, 2023) for $455M [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-controls-jci-acquires-fm-204400717.html#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20,its%20OpenBlue%20digital%20buildings%20offerings). JCI also picked up smaller regional players (e.g. Netherlands-based controls provider **WEBEasy** [fmindustry.com](https://fmindustry.com/2025/01/20/johnson-controls-expands-smart-building-capabilities-with-acquisition/#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20Expands%20Smart%20Building,further%20add%20to%20its%20capabilities) ) and niche solution providers (like **Rescue Air Systems** for firefighter air replenishment) to round out its portfolio [johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/media-center/news/press-releases/2022/10/05/johnson-controls-acquires-rescue-air-systems#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20Acquires%20Rescue%20Air,a%20rapidly%20growing%20vertical). These acquisitions reflect JCI’s push into digital services, IT/OT convergence, and net-zero building solutions. JCI noted that FM:Systems will help “meet the strong demand growth in the smart building market,” which is projected to nearly triple from ~$72B in 2021 to ~$189B by 2030 [facilitiesdive.com](https://www.facilitiesdive.com/news/johnson-controls-fmsystems-digital-workplace-energy-acquisition/688250/#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20noted%20that%20its,according%20to%20Reports%20and%20Data).
- **Siemens** (Smart Infrastructure division) has pursued a **“buy and build”** approach since 2018 to add open software and IoT capabilities. In 2018 alone, Siemens’ Building Technologies unit acquired **J2 Innovations** (Los Angeles-based creator of an open BAS integration framework), **Enlighted** (Silicon Valley smart lighting sensor network startup), and **Building Robotics (Comfy)** (Oakland-based occupant comfort app) [greentechmedia.com](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/siemens-buys-building-robotics#:~:text=Siemens%20bought%20smart%20lighting%20startup,being%20collected%20by%20the%20system) [greentechmedia.com](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/siemens-buys-building-robotics#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%2C%20the%20Oakland%2C%20California,its%20broader%20building%20technologies%20business). These moves gave Siemens cutting-edge software for integration and user engagement. Siemens continued this strategy with deals like **Wattsense** (French IoT BAS platform) and **EcoDomus** (digital twin software) in 2021 [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/siemens-smart-infrastructure-invests-in-software-open-platforms-co-innovation/#:~:text=in%20Zug%2C%20Switzerland%2C%20has%20undertaken,%E2%80%A6), and in 2022 it agreed to buy **Brightly Software** – a leading U.S. cloud-based facilities management platform – for ~$1.6B [thesoftwarereport.com](https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/siemens-ag-acquires-brightly-software-from-clearlake-capital-for-1-87b/#:~:text=Siemens%20AG%20Acquires%20Brightly%20Software,out%20payments). By integrating these acquisitions, Siemens is creating a comprehensive suite (dubbed *Building X* ) for building operations, from core automation to energy analytics and maintenance management [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/siemens-smart-infrastructure-invests-in-software-open-platforms-co-innovation/#:~:text=In%20this%20Research%20Note%2C%20we,Comfy%2C%20a%20US%20provider) [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/siemens-smart-infrastructure-invests-in-software-open-platforms-co-innovation/#:~:text=in%20Zug%2C%20Switzerland%2C%20has%20undertaken,%E2%80%A6).
- **Other Incumbents:****Schneider Electric** and **Carrier** are also key BAS players. Schneider (which acquired TAC and Andover Controls in the 2000s) has more recently invested via its venture arm (SE Ventures) and strategic partnerships (e.g. a 2021 minority stake in Planon IWMS software). **ABB** entered BAS by acquiring **Cylon Controls** in 2020, expanding in HVAC control solutions. **Carrier Global** (spun off from UTC) retained its **Automated Logic** controls business and launched a venture fund; interestingly, Carrier has co-invested in BAS startups (like 75F, detailed later) even as it divested its Lenel security unit to Honeywell [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/honeywell-to-pay-nearly-usd5b-for-carrier-security-unit-to-boost-building-automation-products-8413387#:~:text=,its%20businesses%20announced%20in%20October). We also saw **Acuity Brands** (a lighting manufacturer) acquire **Distech Controls** in 2015, and **Delta Electronics** (Taiwan) acquire **Delta Controls** (Canada) in 2016 – illustrating that adjacent industry players have used M&A to get into smart building controls.

**Trend:** Overall, consolidation has been a defining trend – one analysis identified **352 startup acquisitions in the smart buildings sector from 2012–2022 (28% of identified startups)** [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=Of%20this%20cohort%2C%2028,inactive%20in%20the%20same%20timeframe). The incumbents are buying both traditional BAS companies and high-tech startups to remain competitive in an era of intelligent, connected buildings. This M&A activity is expected to continue as legacy players integrate new capabilities (cloud analytics, AI, cybersecurity, occupant-centric services) and as the fragmented BAS market gradually consolidates.

## Venture Capital and Private Equity Involvement

Alongside corporate acquisitions, **venture capital and private equity investment in BAS and smart building technology has surged** in the last 5–10 years. Since 2015, more than **$31 billion** in venture funding has flowed into *smart building* startups globally, with a record **$5.9B invested in 2022 alone** [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=Since%202015%2C%20total%20capital%20invested,being%20invested%20in%202022%20alone). This influx of capital is driven by several factors:

- **IoT and Cloud Boom:** The mid-2010s saw the rise of IoT and cloud platforms, and investors saw commercial real estate as ripe for disruption. Dozens of startups emerged offering cloud-based building management, wireless sensors, and analytics to optimize building performance. VC investors have funded companies to bring modern software (mobile apps, AI, SaaS models) to an industry historically dominated by legacy OEMs. **By 2022 there were 1,266 startups** (founded since 2012) focusing on smart building operations/management [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=We%20have%20identified%201%2C266%20startups,inactive%20in%20the%20same%20timeframe).
- **Energy & Sustainability Focus:** Buildings account for a large share of energy use and emissions, so “climate tech” and **proptech** funds have targeted BAS innovations that improve efficiency. For example, **Turntide Technologies** (maker of ultra-efficient smart motors for HVAC) raised **$485M** in funding [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=9,A%20provider%20of%20Energy), while **Redaptive** (which finances efficiency retrofits as-a-service) raised **$391M** [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=11,based). These investments reflect confidence that smarter building systems can yield both financial and environmental ROI.
- **Digital and Tenant Experience:** Venture funding also flowed into occupant-focused solutions that *complement* BAS. Startups offering occupancy analytics ( **Density** – $225M raised [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=18,Management%20software%20for%20hospitality%20sector) ), indoor air quality monitoring, or smart security (e.g. **Verkada** – $360M [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=13,changes%20its%20name%20to%20Oosto) ) attracted large rounds. Such technologies often integrate with BAS platforms, expanding the data and functionality available to building operators.

### Notable Venture-Backed BAS Startups

A number of emerging BAS-focused companies have secured significant funding from VCs and strategic partners. Table 2 highlights a few notable startups in this space and their funding:

| Startup | Focus Area | Funding & Key Backers |

**Table 2 – Selected BAS-Focused Startups and Their Funding** (data from PitchBook, press releases)

These examples illustrate the range of innovation:

- **75F** and **BrainBox AI** are injecting advanced AI and IoT into traditional HVAC control, with strategic corporate investors (Siemens, Carrier, ABB) supporting them.
- **Facilio** and **Aquicore** address portfolio-scale management and have drawn capital from both VCs and real estate firms looking to streamline operations.
- **Infogrid** (UK) shows the global spread of BAS startups and attracted one of the larger recent rounds in Europe, including funding from a major tech investor (SoftBank) and a corporate VC (JLL Spark).
- Many startups have **strategic investors** from the industry: e.g., **Carrier and Siemens invested in 75F** [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/06/3022482/0/en/75F-Raises-Additional-45M-Series-B-to-Increase-Energy-Savings-and-Make-Building-Automation-Easier.html#:~:text=round%2C%20one%20of%20the%20largest,approach%20to%20building%20energy%20efficiency); **ABB invested in BrainBox** [pitchbook.com](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/277178-41#:~:text=Acquisition%20pitchbook,Ventures%2C%20Desjardins%20Capital%2C%20EDC); **Johnson Controls, via JCI Ventures, has invested in startups** like Iconics (analytics) and Evoqua (water) to complement its internal developments [johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/media-center/news/press-releases/2022/01/12/johnson-controls-acquires-foghorn#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20acquires%20FogHorn%2C%20expanding,completed%20the%20acquisition%20of%20FogHorn). This blending of corporate and institutional capital underscores how incumbents are using VC investments as a “watchtower” for emerging tech, often leading to partnerships or acquisitions down the line.

### Role of Private Equity

Private equity firms have also been active, particularly in **acquiring mature BAS companies or facilitating roll-ups** of smaller players:

- In 2022, **Platte River Equity** acquired **Building Controls & Solutions (BCS)** – a U.S. distributor of BAS and controls products – from another PE fund, aiming to build a platform of BAS distribution and integration services [platteriverequity.com](https://platteriverequity.com/platte-river-equity-announces-the-acquisition-of-building-controls-solutions/#:~:text=,distributor%20of%20building%20automation). This reflects PE interest in the steady, service-oriented cash flows of BAS integrators and distributors.
- **Accel-KKR**, a tech-focused PE firm, was the owner of FM:Systems and sold it to JCI in 2023 for $455M [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-controls-jci-acquires-fm-204400717.html#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20,its%20OpenBlue%20digital%20buildings%20offerings). Similarly, **Clearlake Capital** owned Brightly Software before selling it to Siemens for ~$1.6B [thesoftwarereport.com](https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/siemens-ag-acquires-brightly-software-from-clearlake-capital-for-1-87b/#:~:text=Siemens%20AG%20Acquires%20Brightly%20Software,out%20payments). These examples show PE firms incubating and then exiting building-tech investments at high valuations.
- Growth equity investors have taken stakes in established BAS solution providers. For instance, **Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL)** launched an automation-focused fund (indicating intent to invest in industrial and building automation companies) [thl.com](https://thl.com/automation/#:~:text=Automation%20,management%20teams%20with%20extensive%20experience). **LLR Partners**, another PE, highlights building automation as a key sector for growth investment [llrpartners.com](https://www.llrpartners.com/industrial-technology-private-equity/building-automation-sector/#:~:text=Building%20Automation%20Sector%20Investor%20,0%20billion).
- Some PE-backed deals in HVAC and fire/life safety also tie into BAS integration. (E.g., **AE Industrial Partners** acquired **United Building Services** in 2023 to grow a platform of complex HVAC services [peprofessional.com](https://peprofessional.com/2025/02/aei-acquires-united-building-solutions-from-crescendo-capital/#:~:text=AEI%20Acquires%20United%20Building%20Solutions,services%2C%20from%20Crescendo%20Capital%20Partners), and **Huron Capital** has an “ExecFactor” platform investing in mechanical and controls contractors [huroncapital.com](https://www.huroncapital.com/news/huron-capitals-execfactor-platform-the-exigent-group-acquires-smith-boughan-and-electrical-automation-services/#:~:text=Huron%20Capital%27s%20ExecFactor%C2%AE%20Platform%20The,services%20for%20complex%20mechanical%20systems) that can implement automation upgrades.)

**Overall**, PE firms see an opportunity to consolidate smaller automation vendors, value-added resellers, and software providers, especially as building owners demand more integrated solutions. However, with rising interest rates in 2023–2024, some large PE deals have slowed (as noted by analysts) cdn.hl.com, even though strategic M&A remains strong. The expectation is that as the BAS market grows, PE will continue targeting companies in this space, especially those with recurring software/service revenue.

## Key Investors and Strategic Players

Investment in the BAS sector comes from a mix of **corporate venture capital, specialist PropTech/Climate funds, and large institutional investors**:

- **Corporate Venture Capital (CVC):** Nearly every major building technology firm now has a venture arm or strategic investment program:
	- *Johnson Controls – JCI Ventures:* Focused on startups in “building technology, security, and energy” [johnsoncontrols.com](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/ventures#:~:text=JCI%20Ventures%20,technology%20and%20industrial%20leader). JCI Ventures has invested in companies like **Latent AI** (edge AI) and leveraged partnerships with startups to enhance its OpenBlue ecosystem.
	- *Honeywell Ventures:* Honeywell has a fund that invested in areas like industrial IoT and building tech (for example, Honeywell Ventures was an early backer of **Tridium** before acquiring it). In 2022 Honeywell Ventures co-led a round in **Nozomi Networks** (OT cybersecurity) to secure critical systems including building controls.
	- *Siemens Next47 and Siemens Energy Ventures:* Siemens’ Next47 unit (now integrated into Siemens) invested in startups spanning IoT and smart infrastructure – notably it invested in **75F** ’s early funding [pitchbook.com](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/119465-74#:~:text=PitchBook%20pitchbook,Next47%2C%20Accurant%20Investments%2C%20and). Siemens Energy Ventures also invests in smart energy management relevant to buildings.
	- *Schneider Electric – SE Ventures:* A €500M fund backing climate and industrial tech [seventures.com](https://www.seventures.com/home.jsp#:~:text=SE%20Ventures%20,venture%20capital%20and%20financial%20alignment). SE Ventures has invested in startups such as **Claroty** (OT security platform that can protect BAS networks, which raised $635M [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=developer%20of%20AI%20facial%20recognition,Software%20platform) ) and **Wattpad** (not BAS, but example). Schneider also directly took stakes (e.g. in Planon).
	- *Carrier Ventures:* Established after Carrier’s 2020 spin-off, it has invested in companies aligned with HVAC and smart building trends (for instance, Carrier participated in **75F** ’s 2025 round [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/06/3022482/0/en/75F-Raises-Additional-45M-Series-B-to-Increase-Energy-Savings-and-Make-Building-Automation-Easier.html#:~:text=round%2C%20one%20of%20the%20largest,approach%20to%20building%20energy%20efficiency) and has a partnership with **Ecobee** for smart thermostats).
	- *Others:***ABB Technology Ventures** (investor in BrainBox AI [pitchbook.com](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/277178-41#:~:text=Acquisition%20pitchbook,Ventures%2C%20Desjardins%20Capital%2C%20EDC) ), **Bosch Ventures**, **UTC Ventures** (pre-UTC split) have all selectively invested in building-related startups.
	Many of these corporates not only provide capital but also become **strategic partners or eventual acquirers**, giving startups access to global customer channels. For the corporates, CVC investments are a way to scout technology and even **pre-empt rivals** – for example, both Carrier and Siemens being investors in 75F [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/06/3022482/0/en/75F-Raises-Additional-45M-Series-B-to-Increase-Energy-Savings-and-Make-Building-Automation-Easier.html#:~:text=round%2C%20one%20of%20the%20largest,approach%20to%20building%20energy%20efficiency), or multiple HVAC firms investing in a promising energy-saving tech.
- **PropTech and Institutional VCs:** A wave of venture firms focused on real estate and climate has funneled money into BAS innovations:
	- **Fifth Wall**, the world’s largest PropTech VC, has a dedicated fund for climate-tech in real estate and has invested in companies like **Enertiv** (building energy monitoring) and **Latch** (smart access for multifamily).
	- **Energy Impact Partners (EIP)**, backed by utility companies, has invested in smart building platforms (for example, EIP invested in **Aquicore** alongside other VCs).
	- **Real Estate Corporate Funds:** Major landlords see value in smart building tech – **JLL Spark** (arm of JLL) has invested in companies like **VergeSense** (occupancy sensing) and **OpenSpace**. **CBRE** has a similar investment program and was an early backer of **Comfy** before its sale. **Brookfield** ’s venture arm not only invested in Facilio [businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220223005778/en/Facilio-Raises-%2435M-Series-B-from-Dragoneer-Brookfield-to-Transform-Real-Estate-Operations-with-AI#:~:text=Facilio%20Raises%20%2435M%20Series%20B,with%20participation%20from%20Brookfield%20Growth) but also launched a climate fund targeting building decarbonization tech.
	- **Generalist VCs:** Top-tier funds have also joined large rounds – e.g., **Sequoia Capital** and **Tiger Global** in smart energy management startups, **Accel** in industrial IoT for buildings, etc., especially during the 2020–2021 investment peak.
- **Private Equity Firms:** As discussed, middle-market PE firms (Platte River, LLR, etc.) are rolling up BAS integrators and product companies. Large-cap PE has been somewhat less prominent in pure BAS (compared to other tech sectors), but notable is **Clearlake’s** successful flip of Brightly to Siemens [thesoftwarereport.com](https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/siemens-ag-acquires-brightly-software-from-clearlake-capital-for-1-87b/#:~:text=Siemens%20AG%20Acquires%20Brightly%20Software,out%20payments). Also, **Blackstone** and **Brookfield** (mega-PE/asset managers) have made direct investments in proptech and energy efficiency projects for their property portfolios, effectively acting as investors in BAS upgrades at scale (for example, financing portfolio-wide IoT retrofits via companies like Redaptive).

**Key takeaway:** A diverse ecosystem of investors now supports the BAS market. **Corporate strategic investors** ensure new solutions align with industry needs, **VCs** drive innovation by funding startups attacking various niches (from HVAC AI to workspace analytics), and **PE** provides growth capital and consolidation. This blend has accelerated the development and adoption of BAS technologies, bringing more attention (and money) to an industry that was once seen as slow-moving. Notably, the high rate of startup **acquisitions (28% of smart building startups since 2012) [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=Of%20this%20cohort%2C%2028,inactive%20in%20the%20same%20timeframe)** shows that many VC-backed companies ultimately exit via M&A to incumbents or other investors, rather than IPO – a trend likely to continue.

## Geographic Trends and Emerging Regions

Investment activity in BAS is **global**, though the intensity varies by region:

- **North America (U.S. & Canada):** The U.S. is the largest market for BAS and has been the hotspot for VC funding. Most of the top-funded startups (75F, BrainBox, Verdigris, etc.) have operations or headquarters in the U.S., and all the major incumbents are active there. The U.S. also sees significant **private equity** activity in building tech and a strong PropTech ecosystem (concentrated in hubs like Silicon Valley, New York, and Boston). Canada has produced notable startups like BrainBox AI (Montreal) and **Ecobee** (Toronto, acquired by Generac in 2021), benefiting from proximity to the U.S. market and government support for clean building tech.
- **Europe:** Europe’s BAS market is mature (led by companies like Siemens, Schneider, ABB, etc.) and is emphasizing sustainability (to meet EU energy efficiency directives). **Venture funding in European smart building startups has grown**, exemplified by **Infogrid (UK)** raising $90M [siliconangle.com](https://siliconangle.com/2023/04/11/ai-driven-building-monitoring-startup-infogrid-raises-90m/#:~:text=The%20Series%20B%20funding%20attracted,according%20to%20data%20from%20Crunchbase) and **Spaceti (Czech)** and **Metrikus (UK)** securing multi-million rounds. Northern Europe in particular has active adopters of smart building tech (Scandinavia’s green building push). **Germany** and **France** have legacy BAS firms and are seeing startups in analytics and IoT (e.g., **Thing-it** in Germany, **Stimergy** in France for energy). **UK** and **Nordics** have strong PropTech scenes. Additionally, European real-estate firms (like **Landsec** or **Allianz Real Estate** ) are investing in smart building pilots, indirectly driving investment to providers of those solutions.
- **Asia-Pacific:****Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing region** for smart building adoption [duckercarlisle.com](https://www.duckercarlisle.com/trends-in-smart-building-part-1/#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20the%20global%20smart,Pacific%20comments%20on%20the%20trend), buoyed by rapid urbanization and smart city initiatives. **China** has a huge building construction pipeline and strong government push for IoT in buildings; however, its startup scene is somewhat insular – companies like **BroadLink, LifeSmart, and Dahua** provide building/home automation but often with domestic funding. Mega-projects in China (and the Middle East) are implementing advanced BAS at scale, sometimes via global firms or local integrators. **India** has a burgeoning smart building startup ecosystem – for instance, **Facilio** was founded in Chennai (even as it serves global clients) and **Zenatix** (Delhi, acquired by Hero Electronix) focuses on IoT for retail/buildings. A recent survey highlighted **11 Indian smart building startups** gaining traction, aided by rising venture funding in India’s tech sector [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/indian-11-smart-building-startups-gaining-traction/#:~:text=India%20Innovation%2011%20Smart%20Building,Indian). **Southeast Asia** (e.g. Singapore) is also a growing market, often served by multinational firms and a few local startups (Singapore’s **SensorFlow** raised funding for hotel HVAC automation). Overall, Asia’s growth rates are high – one source projected APAC’s smart building market CAGR above 30% [duckercarlisle.com](https://www.duckercarlisle.com/trends-in-smart-building-part-1/#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20the%20global%20smart,Pacific%20comments%20on%20the%20trend) – attracting both local investors and the Asian arms of global funds.
- **Middle East & Others:** The Gulf region (UAE, Saudi Arabia) is investing heavily in smart infrastructure (e.g. **NEOM** city project in Saudi). While not a traditional venture hub, these projects often involve partnerships with global BAS firms and could spur local investment (e.g. Saudi’s PIF investing in tech companies). **Australia** has seen activity too – e.g., Australia’s own BAS analytics firms like **BUENO** and **Switch Automation** got funding (Switch, founded in Australia, raised capital in the U.S.).

Geographically, the **U.S. leads in deal volume**, but **Europe and Asia are catching up in innovation and adoption**. Asia-Pacific in particular is expected to contribute the largest share of IoT spending in smart buildings going forward [duckercarlisle.com](https://www.duckercarlisle.com/trends-in-smart-building-part-1/#:~:text=growing%20in%20North%20America%20and,Pacific%20comments%20on%20the%20trend), which suggests more investment in that region’s BAS capabilities. We also see **cross-border investments** – for example, European and Asian funds investing in U.S. startups, and vice-versa (SoftBank’s investment in Infogrid UK [siliconangle.com](https://siliconangle.com/2023/04/11/ai-driven-building-monitoring-startup-infogrid-raises-90m/#:~:text=The%20Series%20B%20funding%20attracted,according%20to%20data%20from%20Crunchbase), or U.S. PE firms acquiring European BAS companies). This cross-pollination is making the BAS investment landscape increasingly global.

## Market Outlook and Future Investment Activity

The outlook for the Building Automation Systems market is robust, with strong growth projections that underpin continued investor interest:

- **Market Growth:** The global BAS market (hardware, software, and services) is projected to **roughly double in the next decade**. One forecast expects the market to grow from about **$57 billion in 2025 to $114 billion by 2035** (7.2% CAGR) [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/11/3023862/0/en/Global-Building-Automation-System-Market-to-Reach-USD-114-064-9-million-by-2035-Driven-by-Services-and-Smart-Infrastructure-Investments.html#:~:text=NEWARK%2C%20Del%3A%2C%20Feb,efficiency%20and%20reducing%20operational%20costs). Another analysis, focusing on broader “smart building” solutions, projects the market to reach **$189 billion by 2030, up from ~$72.6B in 2021** [facilitiesdive.com](https://www.facilitiesdive.com/news/johnson-controls-fmsystems-digital-workplace-energy-acquisition/688250/#:~:text=Johnson%20Controls%20noted%20that%20its,according%20to%20Reports%20and%20Data) – an even faster growth rate (~11% CAGR). Regional outlooks indicate North America and Europe maintaining large shares, with **Asia-Pacific expanding fastest (30%+ CAGR) [duckercarlisle.com](https://www.duckercarlisle.com/trends-in-smart-building-part-1/#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20the%20global%20smart,Pacific%20comments%20on%20the%20trend)** due to new construction and urbanization. Key drivers include: energy efficiency mandates, retrofitting aging buildings with smart tech, healthy building trends (indoor air quality, etc.), and the integration of distributed energy resources (solar, batteries) which require smarter building controls.
- **Continued M&A:** Given this growth and the fragmented competitive landscape, industry experts anticipate **further consolidation**. Large incumbents will likely continue acquiring innovative startups (especially in software, AI and cloud services) to bolster their offerings. We also expect **cross-domain deals** – e.g. IT companies or industrial automation firms acquiring BAS specialists, or building systems companies merging to offer end-to-end smart building platforms. The huge 2024 Honeywell-Carrier security deal [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/honeywell-to-pay-nearly-usd5b-for-carrier-security-unit-to-boost-building-automation-products-8413387#:~:text=,its%20businesses%20announced%20in%20October) could foreshadow more **mega-deals** as conglomerates re-align around automation and smart infrastructure. However, regulators might scrutinize deals that concentrate too much market share in essential building systems.
- **Venture Funding Trends:** While 2021–2022 saw peak venture funding (many startups raised large rounds, some at high valuations), there was a cooling in late 2022–2023 as the tech market corrected. Nevertheless, BAS-related startups are relatively well-positioned because they tie into **tangible ROI (energy savings)** and **ESG objectives**. Investors are increasingly selective, favoring companies with proven deployments. Growth-stage funding is still available for startups demonstrating scalability – e.g. 75F closing $45M in 2025 amid a tougher funding climate [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/06/3022482/0/en/75F-Raises-Additional-45M-Series-B-to-Increase-Energy-Savings-and-Make-Building-Automation-Easier.html#:~:text=MINNEAPOLIS%2C%20Feb,approach%20to%20building%20energy%20efficiency) shows that good companies in this sector can attract capital even when broader VC investment slows. **Corporate VC** involvement remains high, which often provides a lifeline and strategic validation for startups. Going forward, we might see more **strategic partnerships and minority stakes** (without full acquisition) as incumbents try to gain innovation exposure without overpaying.
- **Private Equity and Infrastructure Investment:** As BAS becomes more software-defined and service-oriented, it could draw interest from larger private equity and infrastructure investors. For instance, firms that invest in energy infrastructure might finance large-scale building retrofit programs (treating efficiency as an investable asset). **SPACs and IPOs** were a trend in 2021 (a few smart building-related firms like **View Inc.** went public via SPAC), but most pure-play BAS startups will likely exit through M&A or growth equity sales rather than IPO in the near term. If market conditions improve, a handful of the most successful SaaS-oriented companies in this space could pursue IPOs around 2025–2030, especially those positioned as cleantech (for example, a company enabling significant carbon reductions in buildings could attract public market interest).
- **New Frontiers:** Emerging areas like **AI-driven autonomous buildings**, **cybersecurity for BAS**, and **integrated building-to-grid services** will garner investment. The concept of **“digital twins”** for buildings (creating a real-time digital replica of all building systems) is gaining traction – startups in this niche (software that aggregates BAS data with 3D models) may see funding as property owners seek deeper insights. Additionally, **retrofit solutions** (wireless sensors, plug-and-play controls) are in demand for the massive stock of older buildings; investors recognize the market to upgrade “dumb” buildings into smart ones is even larger than new construction. Companies enabling retrofits at scale (like wireless IoT platform providers) should continue to find eager investors and acquirers.

In summary, the BAS sector’s fundamentals – **rising demand for smarter, greener buildings – point to sustained investment momentum.** We have already seen over $30B funneled into startups since 2015 [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=Since%202015%2C%20total%20capital%20invested,being%20invested%20in%202022%20alone) and a significant portion of those ventures acquired [memoori.com](https://memoori.com/the-top-20-smart-building-startups-by-total-funding/#:~:text=Of%20this%20cohort%2C%2028,inactive%20in%20the%20same%20timeframe), as well as multi-billion dollar strategic acquisitions by incumbents. As the market grows towards the ~$100+ billion range in this decade [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/11/3023862/0/en/Global-Building-Automation-System-Market-to-Reach-USD-114-064-9-million-by-2035-Driven-by-Services-and-Smart-Infrastructure-Investments.html#:~:text=NEWARK%2C%20Del%3A%2C%20Feb,efficiency%20and%20reducing%20operational%20costs), we can expect both ongoing consolidation by major players and continuous infusion of capital for innovation. Geographic expansion (especially in Asia) will introduce new players and investors to the mix, making this a truly global story.

The interplay of **M&A, venture investment, and strategic collaboration** will shape the future of building automation. Stakeholders – from corporate giants to startup founders to investors – are positioning now to capture a share of the smart building boom. Given strong tailwinds (energy costs, climate regulations, occupant expectations), the BAS market is likely to remain a vibrant arena for deals and innovation in the years ahead. Investors and industry watchers should keep an eye on the leading incumbents’ next moves, the crop of startups tackling persistent building challenges, and the evolving demands of building owners that ultimately drive where capital flows.
