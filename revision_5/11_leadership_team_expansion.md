*CONFIDENTIAL - April 2, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines AIQ Solutions' comprehensive strategy for building a world-class leadership team that complements Justin Leader's technical and business expertise across both HomeAIQ and BusinessAIQ verticals. The plan details a phased approach to executive recruiting that aligns with business growth stages, funding milestones, and the staggered launch of our dual-brand strategy. By establishing clear role definitions, identifying specific candidate profiles, and implementing a structured onboarding process, AIQ Solutions will address investor concerns about leadership depth while ensuring operational excellence across both residential and commercial markets. This leadership expansion strategy balances immediate execution needs with long-term organizational development while maintaining unified vision across both business lines.

## Strategic Rationale

1. **Complementary Expertise**: Each leader brings specialized skills that enhance the overall team across both verticals
2. **Vertical Specialization with Platform Unity**: Leaders maintain specialized focus on either residential or commercial while supporting unified platform vision
3. **Cultural Alignment**: All leaders share commitment to open ecosystem vision and customer-first approach
4. **Growth Orientation**: Leadership team balances immediate execution with long-term scaling across markets
