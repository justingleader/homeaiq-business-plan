# Advisory Board Enhancement Strategy
*CONFIDENTIAL - April 2, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines AIQ Solutions' strategic approach to building a world-class advisory board that addresses investor concerns regarding execution risk and technical leadership across both residential and commercial markets. By assembling advisors with complementary expertise spanning Home Assistant technology, commercial building automation, legacy integration, luxury home markets, and ecosystem partnerships, AIQ Solutions will enhance investor confidence, provide critical domain knowledge, and create valuable industry connections. The advisory board structure balances strategic guidance with practical execution support while compensating advisors through a combination of equity and success fees. This dual-market advisory strategy supports our integrated HomeAIQ and BusinessAIQ approach. We specifically need advisors with experience addressing the needs of commercial building facilities managers and engineers.
