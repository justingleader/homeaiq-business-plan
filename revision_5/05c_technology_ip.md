# AIQ Solutions IP Strategy: Five Core Technology Domains

**Overview:** AIQ Solutions is developing a multi-faceted technology platform that spans remote site evaluation, AI-assisted installation, intelligent diagnostics, adaptive user-response systems, and enterprise integration. Each domain not only offers unique customer value but also represents a strategic point of differentiation that can be protected through intellectual property. Below, we outline five key technology areas, why they are valuable to the business, specific patentable concepts within each, and an assessment of the prior art and opportunities. The focus is on a U.S. patent strategy (as the primary market and basis for priority filings), with plans to leverage PCT filings for international protection in key jurisdictions. This approach will build a robust patent portfolio to secure AIQ’s competitive moat while appealing to investor interests in defensibility.

## 1. Remote Evaluation and Live Sales Engineering

**Strategic Value:** This technology enables AIQ’s sales process to scale efficiently by conducting site surveys and customer consultations remotely. Using mobile augmented reality (AR) scanning, a potential customer can capture spatial and equipment data at their facility, which is streamed in real-time to a remote sales engineer. The sales engineer (or an AI assistant) can virtually “walk through” the space, identifying needs and opportunities without costly travel. This remote evaluation accelerates the sales cycle and reduces cost of customer acquisition. Moreover, by layering interactive proposal-building tools on the live AR feed, AIQ can **generate immediate, customized proposals** during the walkthrough. This enhances customer experience (instant quotes/designs) and gives AIQ a first-mover advantage in **“remote sales engineering,”** potentially translating to higher close rates and a wider geographic reach without a large field team.

**Patentable Concepts:** Several novel techniques in this domain could be patented to protect AIQ’s approach. Potential inventions include: 

- *Mobile AR Spatial Capture:* A method for a non-expert user to scan a room or equipment layout with a smartphone app, using AR to map dimensions and recognize key objects (e.g. HVAC units, control panels). The innovation may lie in how the app guides the user (perhaps via overlays or voice prompts) to ensure complete data capture and then automatically stitches together a 3D model or floor plan in real time. This goes beyond generic AR measuring by tailoring it to AIQ’s system needs (identifying specific infrastructure relevant to installations). 
- *Real-Time Remote Expert Collaboration:* A system where the live AR data is streamed to a cloud platform enabling a remote engineer to annotate the scene (placing virtual markers or notes on the customer’s AR view) and to feed instructions or questions back to the user. While basic AR remote assistance exists, AIQ’s twist might include **real-time recognition of elements** in the scene and automated suggestions (e.g. the system identifies a legacy device and recommends an upgrade). The seamless combination of scanning and two-way interaction could be an inventive step.
- *Interactive Proposal Generation:* An integrated tool that, during the AR session, populates a proposal or system design. For example, as measurements and device counts are captured, an AIQ algorithm generates a bill-of-materials and pricing. The remote engineer can adjust options on the fly, and the customer can immediately see the proposed solution rendered in AR (e.g. new devices shown in their space virtually) along with cost estimates. The novelty here is the **dynamic linking of AR visualization with back-end sales/configuration software** to produce a live quote in one session.

By patenting such concepts, AIQ would protect the end-to-end workflow of remote site assessment and instant proposal, a capability that competitors would find hard to replicate without infringing.

**Prior Art & Competitive Patents:** Augmented reality and remote collaboration tools have seen patent activity, but **few have targeted sales engineering specifically**. For instance, major tech players have patented aspects of AR remote assistance. Apple Inc., for example, has recent patents on AR remote guidance – *Apple’s US11727650B2 (granted 2023)* covers systems and methods for AR remote assistance with interactive virtual objects ([US20170213393A1 - Method for representing points of interest in a view of a real  environment on a mobile device and mobile device therefor 
      - Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170213393A1/en#:~:text=method%20for%20three,augmented%20reality%20remote%20assistance)). Another competitor, TechSee, focused on customer support, holds a patent for a remote AR assistance system (US10,567,583 B2 issued 2020) ([Information processing apparatus and method for remote technical ...](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2009036782A1/zh#:~:text=,Methods%20and)). These show that remote AR guidance is a known concept and underscore its importance. However, existing patents primarily address expert guidance for troubleshooting or training, and tend to focus on the mechanics of sharing video/AR annotations. **No known patent directly combines AR scanning with automated proposal generation in a sales context**, which is where AIQ can innovate. There are some related AR commerce patents (e.g. methods for designing and visualizing goods in AR for purchase ([US20100185529A1 - Augmented reality method and system for designing environments and buying/selling goods 
        - Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20100185529A1/en#:~:text=method%20for%20designing%20interior%20and,person%27s%20view%20of%20the%20real))), but those target e-commerce for consumer goods, not enterprise system installation proposals. This relative gap in the prior art is an opportunity. AIQ’s inventive integration of live AR data with a configurator/quote engine could be unique and non-obvious over existing AR remote assistance art.

**Opportunities:** To capitalize on this, AIQ can file patents on the **process workflow** (remote AR survey feeding into proposal generation) and the enabling technologies (e.g. specific algorithms for feature recognition in the scan that tie into product selection). Claiming a broad “method of remotely evaluating a physical environment for system installation using mobile AR and automatically generating a configuration proposal” would stake out valuable ground. We will ensure claims differentiate from known AR assistance by emphasizing elements like sales proposal logic and customer self-service scanning. Given the business importance, multiple filings may be warranted (one for the core workflow, others for sub-components like the AR measurement technique or the interactive proposal UI). This creates a **patent thicket** around remote sales engineering, making it difficult for a competitor to offer similar remote site survey tools without licensing or designing around AIQ’s IP. In the U.S., these filings secure our early priority. Through the PCT, we would later seek coverage in key markets (Europe, China, etc.) where remote site assessment in building systems could become a competitive differentiator, thereby protecting our advantage globally.

## 2. AI-Enhanced Installation Tools

**Strategic Value:** Post-sale, successful installation and commissioning of AIQ’s systems are critical for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The “AI-enhanced installation tools” domain focuses on assisting installers (who may be third-party contractors or the customer’s technicians) to set up and configure AIQ’s hardware/software correctly with minimal friction. Strategically, this reduces installation errors and labor costs, enabling faster go-lives and scaling of AIQ’s products. It also lowers the required skill threshold for installers, which broadens the pool of people who can deploy the systems (important as AIQ expands). By offering intelligent installer support (think of it as a **“virtual installer assistant”**), AIQ can differentiate its product as being **easier and faster to install** compared to competitors. This translates to dollars saved in support calls and warranty fixes, and is a strong selling point for enterprise buyers who worry about deployment disruption. Protecting these installation innovations with patents ensures that competitors cannot easily copy the “easy install” advantage.

**Patentable Concepts:** AIQ’s installer toolkit can incorporate several inventive features:

- *Smart Diagnostics & Auto-Configuration:* When the system is first powered on or connected, it could run an **AI-driven diagnostic check** to verify that all components are correctly installed and configured. For example, the system might automatically detect wiring or configuration errors (wrong port connections, incompatible device addresses on a network, etc.) and either auto-correct them or guide the user to fix them. A patentable method here could be the combination of using machine learning models and predefined rules to compare the detected configuration against an optimal template, pinpointing issues. This goes beyond basic self-test by using AI to anticipate common installation mistakes.
- *Voice-Interactive “Installer Mode”:* Envision a hands-free voice assistant dedicated to installation. The installer could speak commands or questions (“Initialize sensor calibration” or “What’s next?”) and the system (perhaps through a mobile app or the device itself) responds with contextual guidance. The novelty might lie in **context-aware feedback** – the assistant knows the current step of the procedure and the state of the system. For instance, if an installer says “I’ve connected the wires,” the AI can verify via sensor readings that the connections are live, and then proceed. This interactive flow, possibly enhanced by natural language processing tuned for technical tasks, can be patented as a specialized voice-guided installation method.
- *Augmented Reality or Guided Programming:* In addition to voice, the installer tool might use AR on a tablet or smart glasses to overlay instructions on the equipment (e.g., highlighting which switch to flip or how to set a jumper) and then automatically program the system parameters once hardware is set. An “automatic programming” feature could mean that after physical installation, the system configures all devices with optimal settings (like network IDs, calibration values) using an AI that learned from many prior installations. The inventive aspect is using AI to adapt default configurations to the specific environment (for example, adjusting settings if it senses a different device type or a larger space than usual).

Each of these features – if implemented in a novel integrated way – can be subject to patent protection. For instance, a **“method of installing and configuring a building control system using a voice-interactive AI assistant that validates installation steps via sensor data”** could be a valuable patent claim, as it marries voice UI with installation verification logic, something not seen in standard practice.

**Prior Art & Competitive Patents:** The idea of smart installation is emerging alongside IoT and smart home trends, but it’s far from saturated in patents. Big smart-home players have some related IP. For example, Amazon has patented technology for simplifying device setup in the home; one such patent covers automatic detection and pairing of new smart devices by a voice assistant ([Patents That Made Amazon's Alexa a Dominant Voice Assistant](https://patentpc.com/blog/patents-that-made-amazons-alexa-a-dominant-voice-assistant#:~:text=Patents%20That%20Made%20Amazon%27s%20Alexa,to%20identify%20new%20devices)). This shows the push toward voice-guided or automated setup in the consumer space. Additionally, some patents exist for AR-assisted installation in specific industries (for instance, AR tools for solar panel installation or HVAC ductwork alignment), though these are often niche. We did not find **any patents that specifically focus on a comprehensive AI “installer mode”** combining voice, AR, and auto-configuration in the commercial building systems domain – this appears to be an open space. Traditional building automation firms (e.g. Schneider Electric, Siemens) provide installer software tools, but those are usually manual and menu-driven; any patented features there might cover configuration interfaces or wiring tools, rather than AI guidance. The absence of directly analogous patents suggests AIQ can claim broad novelty here. We will, however, keep an eye on related art such as *Google’s approaches to voice-based device configuration* (one Google patent application involves processing voice commands with knowledge of device topology to control complex device sets ([Processing Voice Commands Based on Device Topology](https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/US-20180096683-A1#:~:text=Processing%20Voice%20Commands%20Based%20on,devices%20and%20one%20or))). Those inform us how to differentiate our claims (e.g. focusing on installation-phase tasks, not just general voice control).

**Opportunities:** AIQ should pursue patent claims that cover the **installer assistance process from start to finish.** One application could claim the overall system (voice + context diagnosis + auto-programming). Another could dive into specifics, like *“techniques for AI-driven validation of installation steps”* – for example, patenting how the system uses sensor feedback (voltage levels, network pings, etc.) to confirm that a step is done correctly and then prompts the next step or fixes a parameter. By filing multiple patents, we protect both the user-facing innovation (the installer experience) and the behind-the-scenes innovation (the AI logic that makes it possible). From a strategic view, these patents ensure that even if a competitor tries to offer a “quick install wizard,” they cannot include the advanced AI features without risking infringement. This locks in AIQ’s reputation for easiest installation. As with other domains, we’d file first in the U.S. to establish priority. Given that installation processes might vary by region (and to cover markets where our systems will be sold), we plan to enter the PCT route to later seek patents in Europe, Asia, and other regions, ensuring global coverage of our installer-tool innovations.

## 3. AI Diagnostic Assistants and Dashboards

**Strategic Value:** After installation, customers need to maintain and optimize their systems. AIQ’s platform will include AI-driven diagnostic assistants and real-time dashboards to add value throughout the product’s life. Strategically, this capability elevates AIQ from a one-time equipment vendor to a **solutions provider offering ongoing intelligence**. The AI diagnostic assistant (envisioned as a chatbot or voice bot integrated into the dashboard) helps facilities managers or technicians quickly identify issues (“Why is Conference Room 5 too warm?”) and get recommended fixes. It can also proactively detect anomalies or inefficiencies and alert users before they become problems. The real-time dashboard, powered by AI analytics, gives an intuitive view of system performance, energy usage, etc., with the AI highlighting what actually matters. This is a huge selling point – it translates to lower downtime, reduced maintenance costs, and insights into energy savings for customers. From an investor perspective, these features can support recurring revenue (software subscriptions or service contracts) and provide a data advantage (learning from operational data improves the AI). Owning IP here means AIQ can confidently market these unique AI capabilities without competitors easily duplicating them.

**Patentable Concepts:** Key innovations in this domain include:

- *AI Troubleshooting Chatbot:* A conversational interface (text or voice) that interfaces with building systems or equipment controllers. What’s patentably novel is that the chatbot isn’t just a FAQ bot; it actually *detects system states and troubleshoots*. For example, if a building zone is not cooling properly, the user can ask the AI assistant, “diagnose the cooling issue in Zone 5.” The assistant would retrieve sensor and actuator data, identify anomalies (perhaps a stuck valve or an underperforming compressor via pattern recognition), and report the likely cause and solution (“Valve X might be stuck closed; I recommend checking or replacing it”). It could even generate a maintenance ticket automatically. A specific inventive method here could be the combination of natural language processing with a rule-based expert system and machine learning anomaly detection on live data – integrating these to provide an answer in human-readable form. 
- *Automated Root-Cause Analysis & Solution Generation:* Extending the above, AIQ could patent the algorithms that generate human-friendly explanations or step-by-step solution instructions. For instance, the system might use a knowledge graph of HVAC (or relevant domain) faults to infer causes from symptoms, a technique that could be unique when combined with real-time sensor data streams. The novelty might lie in how the system automatically goes from raw data to a **ranked list of probable causes and suggested fixes** without human intervention.
- *Adaptive Dashboards with AI Insights:* Traditional dashboards show raw metrics and maybe simple alerts. AIQ’s dashboard could have an **adaptive UI** where the AI highlights unusual patterns (e.g. “Alert: Pump 2 energy consumption 15% above normal this week”) and maybe even reconfigures the dashboard to show relevant charts when an issue is detected. Patentable elements could include the way the dashboard’s content changes based on an AI model’s analysis of data trends. Additionally, the integration of a chatbot on the same dashboard that can both answer queries and also push notifications (“I noticed a trend, would you like an explanation?”) can be part of the innovation.

By protecting these aspects, AIQ ensures that its combination of AI analytics + conversational interface remains a unique offering. This fosters customer loyalty (since the system becomes very sticky once it’s providing continuous operational help) and creates a **defensible IP-backed service**.

**Prior Art & Competitive Patents:** The field of AI for system diagnostics is active, especially in HVAC and building management. There are patents on automated fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) algorithms. For example, a team at Harvard’s Center for Green Buildings and Cities recently filed a patent application for an “Open Platform for Automated HVAC Fault Detection and Smart Building Applications,” which describes using data-driven algorithms to detect energy inefficiencies and system faults in real time ([CGBC Files New Patent on Fault Detection Platform and Smart Building Applications - Center for Green Buildings and Cities](https://harvardcgbc.org/cgbc-files-new-patent-on-fault-detection-platform-and-smart-building-applications/#:~:text=patent%20application%20for%20the%20following,faults%20quickly%20to%20avoid%20costs)). This indicates that aspects like using data to detect faults are known and being patented by others. Large HVAC companies (Carrier, Daikin, etc.) also have significant patent portfolios in this space. Notably, Carrier has been innovating with AI for building systems; one analysis of Carrier’s patents highlighted a novel approach of using an *AI-assisted chatbot* for building control, considered a new concept in their patent landscape ([Sustainable Air-Conditioning Systems Enabled by Artificial Intelligence: Research Status, Enterprise Patent Analysis, and Future Prospects](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/12/7514#:~:text=also%20uses%20the%20KBS%20to,right%20corner%20of)). This shows that even incumbents see a chatbot interface for system management as novel – Carrier’s method enabling users to query a knowledge base via chat was identified as unprecedented in research literature and thus likely patented by them ([Sustainable Air-Conditioning Systems Enabled by Artificial Intelligence: Research Status, Enterprise Patent Analysis, and Future Prospects](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/12/7514#:~:text=also%20uses%20the%20KBS%20to,right%20corner%20of)). These competitive patents and applications inform us that while basic fault detection and even some AI-driven analytics have prior art, **the integration of a conversational assistant with real-time diagnostics is still emerging and presents patent gaps**. There is little prior art on AI systems that both monitor data and engage in dialogue with users to resolve issues – most existing solutions are either pure analytics dashboards or separate chatbot support tools, not a unified system. 

**Opportunities:** AIQ can navigate around existing FDD patents by focusing claims on the **user-facing AI assistant aspects and the unified workflow**. For instance, a core patent could be *“System and method for interactive AI-based diagnostics in building management, comprising a natural language interface coupled with real-time data analytics to identify and remediate system faults.”* This would highlight the conversational query/response nature combined with automated analysis. Another set of claims could target the dashboard integration: *“An adaptive visualization interface that reconfigures based on detected anomalies and incorporates an AI agent for user interaction.”* By filing multiple patents – one on the backend analysis (possibly emphasizing a novel machine learning approach we use), one on the chatbot integration, and one on the adaptive UI – AIQ can protect the full breadth of this domain. This ensures that even if competitors have analytics or basic chatbots, they cannot offer the seamless experience or specific methods AIQ provides without infringing. In terms of strategy, we file in the U.S. first, which covers our primary market and gives us a strong foundation. Internationally, building automation analytics is a global need, so we would pursue PCT filings to later enter Europe, China, and other major markets. Especially in regions where local companies might try to mimic our solutions, having patents will deter copycats or give us leverage (licensing or partnerships). An added benefit: a strong patent portfolio here could justify a higher valuation, as investors see that our AI/analytics, which could be the source of recurring SaaS revenue, is well protected.

## 4. Environmental Sensing and Behavior-Driven Optimization

**Strategic Value:** This is a forward-looking, innovative domain where AIQ’s system not only responds to direct inputs (like button presses or app commands) but also to indirect cues from the environment and user behavior. The idea is to make the system **hyper-aware of user satisfaction and intent.** For example, consider a scenario: a user is repeatedly pressing a button on a control panel out of frustration, or a person audibly curses because the lights won’t turn on – the system detects these signals and takes action (adjust settings or prompt a help message). Similarly, if a toilet is flushed multiple times in a short interval (perhaps indicating it didn’t work the first time), an “intelligent restroom system” might flag a plumbing issue. The strategic value here is **creating a superior user experience and a proactive service mechanism**. AIQ’s products could stand out as “the system that listens and learns.” While this is somewhat unconventional, in enterprise settings it can translate to fewer complaints and service calls – the system self-corrects or alerts facility managers to intervene before the user even submits a ticket. Moreover, this capability could lead to entirely new features (e.g. a building environment that adapts dynamically to occupant mood or behavior). For investors, it showcases AIQ’s commitment to innovation and leveraging AI/IoT in novel ways, potentially opening up new IP that could be licensed to others (since it overlaps with fields like smart home, smart office, etc.).

**Patentable Concepts:** The marriage of environmental sensing with behavior recognition is ripe for patentable invention. Possible elements include:

- *Acoustic Detection of Distress or Frustration:* A method for continuously monitoring ambient sound for indicators of frustration – e.g., **detecting certain keywords (like curses)** or stressed tone of voice. The inventive step might be tying this detection to an automated system response. For instance, patent a feature where a voice recognition module, upon detecting an expletive or angry tone in proximity to a device, triggers that device to enter a help mode (maybe a voice assistant says “It looks like you’re having an issue, can I help?” or it sends a notification to support). The novelty lies in the specific application of emotion AI for facility controls, not just generic speech recognition. As Emotional AI tech becomes common in customer service, AIQ would be applying it in a new context ([Rise of Emotional AI: Key Players and Patent Trends - Sagacious IP](https://sagaciousresearch.com/blog/rise-of-emotional-ai-key-players-and-patent-trends/#:~:text=machines%20to%20understand%20and%20appropriately,the%20capacity%20to%20experience%20feelings)).
- *Sensor Fusion for User Behavior:* Beyond audio, use sensors like accelerometers or usage logs to infer frustration. For example, **repeated rapid button presses** on a thermostat or elevator panel can be interpreted as impatience. A patentable invention could define a “frustration pattern signature” (X inputs within Y seconds) for a given interface and an automated adjustment (e.g., the elevator system cancels and reorders calls if it detects spamming of the button). There have been patents in related fields – for instance, Rovi Technologies (now Adeia) had a patent on recognizing when a user is frustrated with a device or interface and adjusting the system behavior ([US20110279359A1 - Systems and methods for monitoring motion sensor signals and adjusting interaction modes 
        - Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110279359A1/en#:~:text=Described%20herein%20are%20systems%20and,for%20patterns%20indicative%20of%20user)). AIQ’s opportunity is to tailor such patterns to building systems and IoT devices. Each type of device (lighting, climate control, plumbing) might have telltale user actions that signal a problem.
- *Behavior-Driven Optimization Actions:* Another concept is using these detections not just for immediate response but for **long-term optimization**. For example, if a room’s lights are frequently being overridden manually (people keep turning them brighter), the system could learn preferences and adjust the default brightness schedule. Or if users often bypass an automated setting, the AI could suggest a change in configuration. Patentable here is the feedback loop: sensing human behavior patterns and algorithmically adjusting control parameters over time. Essentially, the system “learns” from frustrated actions to avoid causing frustration in the future.

**Prior Art & Competitive Patents:** This domain intersects with the emerging field of affective computing and user-centric IoT control. As noted, there is relevant prior art in consumer tech – e.g., the Rovi patent for detecting user frustration via motion sensors and adjusting an interaction mode ([US20110279359A1 - Systems and methods for monitoring motion sensor signals and adjusting interaction modes 
        - Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110279359A1/en#:~:text=Described%20herein%20are%20systems%20and,for%20patterns%20indicative%20of%20user)) is a proof that such ideas have been explored (that patent specifically monitored things like erratic remote-control usage and then simplified a TV’s interface in response). Also, broader trends in Emotional AI show many companies are developing tech to sense emotions (via voice, facial recognition, etc.) to improve user experience ([Rise of Emotional AI: Key Players and Patent Trends - Sagacious IP](https://sagaciousresearch.com/blog/rise-of-emotional-ai-key-players-and-patent-trends/#:~:text=machines%20to%20understand%20and%20appropriately,the%20capacity%20to%20experience%20feelings)). However, in the domain of building or equipment controls, this is largely untapped. We have not seen patents where, say, a smart building adjusts itself because it “heard” an occupant swearing at a device. There may be some academic research on using frustration detection for human-computer interaction, but as far as patent landscapes go, it’s relatively blue ocean in our specific applied context. One could consider related patents in automotive (cars detecting driver irritation or fatigue) or smartphone UX, but AIQ’s focus (built environment and devices) is distinct. We should be mindful if any smart home companies have begun patenting things like “mood-based home automation,” but our preliminary survey suggests an opportunity to lead in this niche. 

**Opportunities:** AIQ can pioneer patents here to stake an early claim. A first patent could broadly cover *“monitoring user interactions and environmental cues to infer user dissatisfaction and automatically adjusting system operations accordingly.”* This might include multiple embodiments (audio analysis, device usage patterns, etc.) – we’d detail various sensors and signals to cast a wide net. Subsequent patents could drill down: one on acoustic frustration detection algorithms (perhaps novel because we’d tune them for certain acoustical environments like machine rooms vs. offices), another on specific responsive actions (like a plumbing system that detects multiple flushes and runs a pipe cleaning cycle or alerts maintenance). The key is to claim the **feedback/adaptation loop** in contexts that matter to us. This IP, while maybe a bit outside the core functionality, could become very important if competitors try to add “smart learning” features to their products. AIQ’s patents would give us leverage or at least a head start. Additionally, owning patents in this space could position AIQ for cross-industry opportunities (e.g. licensing the tech to a smart home firm or car maker down the line, since it’s somewhat universal). We will file in the U.S. first – capturing the novelty before anyone else does. For international protection, we’d likely file PCT and later pursue key markets selectively (perhaps focusing on regions with high smart building adoption). These patents also serve as strategic assets in storytelling: we can say AIQ is not just following industry trends but setting them, with IP to prove it.

## 5. Commercial Protocol Integration

**Strategic Value:** AIQ’s platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with a variety of existing communication protocols and enterprise systems – from building automation networks (like BACnet for HVAC/building controls, CAN bus for devices/vehicles, OPC-UA for industrial equipment) to business software APIs (like Salesforce for CRM data). This domain is crucial because **interoperability** is often a deciding factor for enterprise customers. By having a robust integration layer, AIQ ensures its solutions can plug into clients’ current ecosystems rather than requiring a rip-and-replace. Strategically, this means faster deployment, more utility (our system can trigger workflows in, say, Salesforce or maintenance management systems automatically), and a stickier product (once AIQ’s platform is the central “hub” connecting all protocols, it’s hard to remove). From a business perspective, this could open additional revenue streams – e.g. offering integration as a service, or using the data flowing through our system to provide analytics across the enterprise. Protecting IP here is about **defending the technical bridge** that connects disparate systems, which is a core part of AIQ’s value proposition. It prevents competitors from easily claiming “we integrate everything too” unless they invest significant effort to avoid our protected methods.

**Patentable Concepts:** Integration technology often involves complex software architecture that can indeed be patented (despite being software-focused, as long as it’s novel and non-obvious). Potential inventions AIQ can protect include:

- *Adaptive Protocol Gateway:* This would be a universal gateway device or software module that **automatically translates and maps data between protocols**. The novelty could be in how it uses AI or configuration templates to self-adapt to new protocols. For example, a gateway that plugs into a BACnet network and an OPC-UA system and intelligently matches data points (perhaps using semantic analysis of point names or units). If AIQ has developed a way for a gateway to learn the ontology of a new protocol and configure mappings with minimal human setup, that’s highly patentable. It goes beyond fixed protocol converters by being *adaptive*.
- *Unified Messaging Bus:* AIQ might create a unified event bus where messages from any integrated protocol (field devices or cloud APIs) are normalized into a common format. The patented innovation could be in how we achieve real-time normalization and routing with low latency, or how the bus handles **meta-data to preserve the origin and context of messages across different standards**. For instance, a message from a CAN bus sensor and one from a BACnet thermostat could both be represented in one data model internally. We saw that Tridium’s Niagara Framework – a major integration platform in building automation – touts a *“unique, patented component model that transforms data from diverse external systems into uniform software components”* ([Tridium Niagara 4 Supervisor – iSMA CONTROLLI](https://www.ismacontrolli.dk/portfolio-item/tridium-niagara-ax-supervisor-02/#:~:text=The%20core%20concept%20of%20Niagara,environment%20used%20to%20build%20applications)). That indicates such integration models are patent-worthy and indeed Niagara’s approach is protected. AIQ can develop its own improved model (perhaps more AI-driven, or more open/extensible) and seek similar protection.
- *Low-Code Plugin Architecture:* To integrate with many systems (especially enterprise software like Salesforce, SAP, etc.), a low-code or plugin-based approach can be key. AIQ could patent a **plugin architecture** where new protocol drivers or API connectors can be added on the fly, possibly even by third-parties, in a secure sandboxed way. If our platform allows, say, a developer to write a small script or use a visual interface to map a new protocol without recompiling the whole system, that architecture (including how plugins interface with the core message bus and ensure stability/security) can be novel. For example, an “extensible, low-code integration platform” was recently granted a U.S. patent in 2025 ([U.S. Patent for Extensible, low-code integration platform Patent (Patent #  12,248,918 issued March 11, 2025) - Justia Patents Search](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12248918#:~:text=Integrated%20system%20enables%20implementors%20to,factor)) ([U.S. Patent for Extensible, low-code integration platform Patent (Patent #  12,248,918 issued March 11, 2025) - Justia Patents Search](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12248918#:~:text=module%20enables%20an%20entity%20external,data%20packets%20between%20the%20systems)), showing that innovations in simplifying integration are patentable. AIQ’s spin might be specifically for IoT/building protocols combined with enterprise cloud APIs, and ensuring things like unified authentication, error handling across systems, etc., all done with minimal coding.

 ([Tridium Niagara 4 Supervisor – iSMA CONTROLLI](https://www.ismacontrolli.dk/portfolio-item/tridium-niagara-ax-supervisor-02/)) *Illustration:* Integration is central to AIQ’s platform. Much like the Niagara Framework’s approach of unifying diverse protocols ([Tridium Niagara 4 Supervisor – iSMA CONTROLLI](https://www.ismacontrolli.dk/portfolio-item/tridium-niagara-ax-supervisor-02/#:~:text=The%20core%20concept%20of%20Niagara,environment%20used%20to%20build%20applications)), AIQ’s system will integrate *protocols, devices, controllers, and applications* into one cohesive environment. Patent protection will cover the unique methods by which AIQ achieves this seamless interoperability.

**Prior Art & Competitive Patents:** The landscape of integration middleware has numerous players, and some have patented core aspects. As mentioned, Honeywell’s Tridium/Niagara holds patents for their component model of integration ([Tridium Niagara 4 Supervisor – iSMA CONTROLLI](https://www.ismacontrolli.dk/portfolio-item/tridium-niagara-ax-supervisor-02/#:~:text=The%20core%20concept%20of%20Niagara,environment%20used%20to%20build%20applications)). Big building automation companies like Johnson Controls (JCI) have extensive patent portfolios in building control and likely some covering network integrations (JCI alone holds thousands of patents in building automation and control systems ([Smart Building Patents & the JCI Willow Partnership - Memoori](https://memoori.com/what-jci-willow-partnership-smart-building-patents/#:~:text=Smart%20Building%20Patents%20%26%20the,revenue%20global%20smart%20building%20leader))). Industrial automation firms (Rockwell, Siemens) might have patents on bridging protocols like OPC-UA or fieldbus integration. Additionally, tech companies like NTT have patents on IoT message bus architectures (for example, NTT’s patent on a message bus agent for IoT connectivity ([US-20160205106-A1 - Systems and Methods for Providing Iot ...](https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/US-20160205106-A1#:~:text=,US)) suggests work in unified messaging). The **good news** for AIQ is that while there is prior art, it tends to be siloed – one patent might cover BACnet/OPC gateway specifics, another covers an IT integration platform for identity management ([U.S. Patent for Extensible, low-code integration platform Patent (Patent #  12,248,918 issued March 11, 2025) - Justia Patents Search](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12248918#:~:text=Integrated%20system%20enables%20implementors%20to,factor)). There isn’t a single dominant patented method for the kind of *holistic integration across building systems and enterprise systems* that AIQ is aiming for. By surveying these patents, we ensure our approach is distinguishable: e.g., Niagara’s patents cover its specific framework (which we won’t copy), and other patents might cover fixed protocol conversions, whereas our focus is on adaptive and AI-orchestrated integration, which is relatively novel. In summary, the space is competitive, but **there is room for innovative approaches** that we can claim as unique.

**Opportunities:** AIQ should file patents that capture its integration framework’s distinguishing features. One key claim could be *“an adaptive integration engine that ingest data from multiple industry-standard protocols and enterprise application APIs, normalizes the data, and provides a unified interface with minimal manual configuration.”* Within that, sub-claims might detail how an AI algorithm maps data points between systems or how a low-code interface allows new integrations to be onboarded quickly. Another patent could focus on reliability/security innovations – for example, *“a unified messaging bus that guarantees delivery and transaction consistency across heterogeneous networks (BACnet, CAN, cloud APIs), with a plugin architecture enabling extensibility.”* If we have developed any specific technique (say, a novel use of knowledge graphs to model different protocols or a way to use machine learning to auto-generate data translators), those should be highlighted in claims for their technical merit. 

Additionally, given many integration technologies exist, we might pursue some **defensive publications or narrow claims** around known areas to prevent others from boxing us out; but our main strategy is to patent what we truly innovate. Successfully patented, AIQ will own the IP for a “universal integrator” in our market niche. This not only protects our product but could become a licensing asset; others wanting to integrate systems in a similar way might have to license our patents (or we could spin off the integration layer technology as its own licensable module). As usual, the U.S. filing comes first (huge market and legal system favorable for software patents when done right). We’ll follow with PCT to keep the global option open – likely targeting regions with heavy building automation usage (Europe, China, Middle East). 

Lastly, it’s worth noting the **defensive value**: if a competitor or even a large player tried to claim an integration method later, having our patents will allow us to cross-licence or counter-assert, thus safeguarding our freedom to operate. Investors can take comfort that AIQ is not exposing itself to undue IP risk in this critical area and is instead building an **IP fortress around system interoperability**.

## Patent Portfolio Development and International Strategy

Building on the above domain-by-domain strategy, AIQ Solutions will cultivate a comprehensive patent portfolio that covers both the breadth and depth of our technology. **In total, we envision filings across all five core domains, amounting to a well-rounded portfolio (e.g., 8–12 key patent families over the next 1-2 years).** This portfolio creates a **multi-layered defense**: even if one aspect of our solution is challenged or designed-around, many other aspects remain protected, making it extremely difficult for a competitor to mimic the full AIQ platform without infringing multiple patents.

Our approach to filing will be systematic and proactive:

- **U.S. First Filing:** For each invention, we will file in the United States first (often as a provisional to secure a quick priority date, followed by a non-provisional within 12 months). The U.S. is our initial market and the most significant for enforcement and licensing value. U.S. patents will give investors confidence due to the strong enforcement environment and precedents in software/tech patents (especially since our inventions are tied to tangible systems and thus patent-eligible). We will ensure our claims are drafted with the latest USPTO guidance in mind (particularly for software/AI-related aspects, to navigate any Section 101 concerns about abstract ideas by emphasizing the concrete improvements in device/system functionality).

- **International Protection (PCT and National Phases):** While U.S. patents are the cornerstone, we recognize that AIQ’s market and competitors are global. We intend to file a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application for each priority US filing. The PCT route preserves our ability to seek protection in virtually all major markets within 30 months of the priority date. This gives us time to gauge commercial interest in various regions and the competitive landscape before committing to national filings. Our likely national phase targets are **Europe (EPO)** – covering key countries where building automation is advanced (Germany, France, UK, etc.), **China** – both for its huge market and manufacturing base (and Chinese companies are active in AI and building tech, so we want to prevent unauthorized use of our inventions), and other regions as needed (for example, Canada and Australia if there’s market traction, or specific Asian markets like Japan or South Korea if relevant). For each domain, we will also consider filing in jurisdictions of major competitors if different (e.g., if a big competitor is based in Japan, securing a Japanese patent might be strategically useful even if the direct market isn’t huge).

- **Continuation Practice:** In the U.S., we will utilize continuation applications to broaden or adjust claim scope over time. For example, after the first patent in a domain is allowed, we might file continuations to pursue additional claim sets (perhaps covering slightly different embodiments or focusing on specific commercial implementations). This allows us to create a **thicket of patents** in each domain, increasing the difficulty for competitors to design around our IP. It also extends the life of our patent pipeline, providing fresh patents coming out over a span of years, which is attractive to investors as it shows ongoing innovation and protection.

- **Trade Secrets and Know-How:** While patents are the focus here, we will complement them with trade secret protection for certain algorithms or data (especially in the AI domains 3 and 4). For instance, the training data or specific machine learning techniques might be kept secret to avoid disclosure in a patent – we will patent the high-level system and integration, but keep some secret sauce internally. This dual approach ensures maximum protection (patents for the broad strokes that can be reverse-engineered by a competitor, trade secrets for the parts that are hidden inside our cloud).
